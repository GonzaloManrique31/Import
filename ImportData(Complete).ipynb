To have discovered a law not\\r\\nonly applicable to matter on this earth, but to the planets and sun\\r\\nand stars beyond, is a triumph which places Newton among the super-men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Newton\\'s law of gravitation must have meant to the people of his\\r\\nday can be pictured only if we conceive what the effect upon us would\\r\\nbe if someone--say Marconi--were actually to succeed in getting into\\r\\ntouch with beings on another planet. Newton\\'s law increased confidence\\r\\nin the universality of earthly laws; and it strengthened belief in\\r\\nthe cosmos as a law-abiding mechanism.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton\\'s Law. The attraction between any two bodies is proportional\\r\\nto their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the\\r\\ndistance that separates them. This is the concentrated form of\\r\\nNewton\\'s law. If we apply this law to two such bodies as the\\r\\nsun and the earth, we can state that the sun attracts the earth,\\r\\nand the earth, the sun. Furthermore, this attractive power will\\r\\ndepend upon the distance between these two bodies. Newton showed\\r\\nthat if the distance between the sun and the earth were doubled the\\r\\nattractive power would be reduced not to one-half, but to one-fourth;\\r\\nif trebled, the attractive power would be reduced to one-ninth. If,\\r\\non the other hand, the distance were halved, the attractive power\\r\\nwould be not merely twice, but four times as great. And what is true\\r\\nof the sun and the earth is true of every body in the firmament, and,\\r\\nas Professor Rutherford has recently shown, even of the bodies which\\r\\nmake up the solar system of the almost infinitesimal atom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis mysterious attractive power that one body possesses for another is\\r\\ncalled \"gravitation,\" and the law which regulates the motion of bodies\\r\\nwhen under the spell of gravitation is the law of gravitation. This\\r\\nlaw we owe to Newton\\'s genius.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton\\'s Predecessors. We can best appreciate Newton\\'s momentous\\r\\ncontribution to astronomy by casting a rapid glance over the state\\r\\nof the science prior to the seventeenth century--that is, prior to\\r\\nNewton\\'s day. Ptolemy\\'s conception of the earth as the center of the\\r\\nuniverse held undisputed sway throughout the middle ages. In those days\\r\\nPtolemy was in astronomy what Aristotle was in all other knowledge:\\r\\nthey were the gods who could not but be right. Did not Aristotle say\\r\\nthat earth, air, fire and water constituted the four elements? Did\\r\\nnot Ptolemy say that the earth was the center around which the sun\\r\\nrevolved? Why, then, question further? Questioning was a sacrilege.\\r\\n\\r\\nCopernicus (1473-1543), however, did question. He studied much and\\r\\nthought much. He devoted his whole life to the investigation of the\\r\\nmovements of the heavenly bodies. And he came to the conclusion that\\r\\nPtolemy and his followers in succeeding ages had expounded views which\\r\\nwere diametrically opposed to the truth. The sun, said Copernicus,\\r\\ndid not move at all, but the earth did; and far from the earth being\\r\\nthe center of the universe, it was but one of several planets revolving\\r\\naround the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influence of the church, coupled with man\\'s inclination to exalt\\r\\nhis own importance, strongly tended against the acceptance of such\\r\\nheterodox views. Among the many hostile critics of the Copernican\\r\\nsystem, Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) stands out pre-eminently. This\\r\\nconscientious observer bitterly assailed Copernicus for his\\r\\nsuggestion that the earth moved, and developed a scheme of his own\\r\\nwhich postulated that the planets revolved around the sun, and planets\\r\\nand sun in turn revolved around the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority applauded Tycho; a small, very small group of insurgents\\r\\nhad faith in Copernicus. The illustrious Galileo (1564-1642)\\r\\nbelonged to the minority. The telescope of his invention unfolded\\r\\na view of the universe which belied the assertions of the many, and\\r\\nstrengthened his belief in the Copernican theory. \"It (the Copernican\\r\\ntheory) explains to me the cause of many phenomena which under the\\r\\ngenerally accepted theory are quite unintelligible. I have collected\\r\\narguments for refuting the latter, but I do not venture to bring\\r\\nthem to publication.\" So wrote Galileo to his friend, Kepler. \"I do\\r\\nnot venture to bring them to publication.\" How significant of the\\r\\ntimes--of any time, one ventures to add.\\r\\n\\r\\nGalileo did overcome his hesitancy and published his views. They\\r\\naroused a storm. \"Look through my telescope,\" he pleaded. But the\\r\\nprofessors would not; neither would the body of Inquisitors. The\\r\\nInquisition condemned him: \"The proposition that the sun is in\\r\\nthe center of the earth and immovable from its place is absurd,\\r\\nphilosophically false and formally heretical; because it is expressly\\r\\ncontrary to the Holy Scriptures.\" And poor Galileo was made to utter\\r\\nwords which were as far removed from his thoughts as his oppressors\\'\\r\\nideas were from the truth: \"I abjure, curse and detest the said errors\\r\\nand heresies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe truth will out. Others arose who defied the majority and the\\r\\npowerful Inquisition. Most prominent of all of these was Galileo\\'s\\r\\nfriend, Kepler. Though a student of Tycho, Kepler did not hesitate to\\r\\nespouse the Copernican system; but his adoption of it did not mean\\r\\nunqualified approval. Kepler\\'s criticism was particularly directed\\r\\nagainst the Copernican theory that the planets revolve in circles. This\\r\\nwas boldness in the extreme. Ever since Aristotle\\'s discourse on the\\r\\ncircle as a perfect figure, it was taken for granted that motion\\r\\nin space was circular. Nature is perfect; the circle is perfect;\\r\\nhence, if the sun revolves, it revolves in circles. So strongly\\r\\nwere men imbued with this \"perfection,\" that Copernicus himself fell\\r\\nvictim. The sun no longer moved, but the earth and the planets did,\\r\\nand they moved in a circle. Radical as Copernicus was, a few atoms\\r\\nof conservatism remained with him still.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot so Kepler. Tycho had taught him the importance of careful\\r\\nobservation,--to such good effect, that Kepler came to the conclusion\\r\\nthat the revolution of the earth around the sun takes the form of an\\r\\nellipse rather than a circle, the sun being stationed at one of the\\r\\nfoci of the ellipse.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo picture this ellipse, we shall ask the reader to stick two pins\\r\\na short distance apart into a piece of cardboard, and to place over\\r\\nthe pins a loop of string. With the point of a pencil draw the loop\\r\\ntaut. As the pencil moves around the two pins the curve so produced\\r\\nwill be an ellipse. The positions of the two pins represent the\\r\\ntwo foci.\\r\\n\\r\\nKepler\\'s observation of the elliptical rotation of the planets was the\\r\\nfirst of three laws, quantitatively expressed, which paved the way\\r\\nfor Newton\\'s law. Why did the planets move in just this way? Kepler\\r\\ntried to answer this also, but failed. It remained for Newton to\\r\\nsupply the answer to this question.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton\\'s Law of Gravitation. The Great Plague of 1666 drove Newton\\r\\nfrom Cambridge to his home in Lincolnshire. There, according to the\\r\\ncelebrated legend, the philosopher sitting in his little garden one\\r\\nfine afternoon, fell into a deep reverie. This was interrupted by the\\r\\nfall of an apple, and the thinker turned his attention to the apple\\r\\nand its fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must not be supposed that Newton \"discovered\" gravity. Apples\\r\\nhad been seen to fall before Newton\\'s time, and the reason for their\\r\\nreturn to earth was correctly attributed to this mysterious force of\\r\\nattraction possessed by the earth, to which the name \"gravity\" had been\\r\\ngiven. Newton\\'s great triumph consisted in showing that this \"gravity,\"\\r\\nwhich was supposed to be a peculiar property residing in the earth,\\r\\nwas a universal property of matter; that it applied to the moon and the\\r\\nsun as well as to the earth; that, in fact, the motions of the moon\\r\\nand the planets could be explained on the basis of gravitation. But\\r\\nhis supreme triumph was to give, in one sublime generalization,\\r\\nquantitative expression to the motion regulating heavenly bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us follow Newton in his train of thought. An apple falls from a\\r\\ntree 50 yards high. It would fall from a tree 500 yards high. It would\\r\\nfall from the highest mountain top several miles above sea level. It\\r\\nwould probably fall from a height much above the mountain top. Why\\r\\nnot? Probably the further up you go the less does the earth attract\\r\\nthe apple, but at what distance does this attraction stop entirely?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nearest body in space to the earth is the moon, some 240,000 miles\\r\\naway. Would an apple reach the earth if thrown from the moon? But\\r\\nperhaps the moon itself has attractive power? If so, since the apple\\r\\nwould be much nearer the moon than the earth, the probabilities are\\r\\nthat the apple would never reach the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut hold! The apple is not the only object that falls to the\\r\\nground. What is true of the apple is true of all other bodies--of all\\r\\nmatter, large and small. Now there is the moon itself, a very large\\r\\nbody. Does the earth exert any gravitational pull on the moon? To\\r\\nbe sure, the moon is many thousands of miles away, but the moon is\\r\\na very large body, and perhaps this size is in some way related to\\r\\nthe power of attraction?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then if the earth attracts the moon, why does not the moon fall\\r\\nto the earth?\\r\\n\\r\\nA glance at the accompanying figure will help to answer this\\r\\nquestion. We must remember that the moon is not stationary, but\\r\\ntravelling at tremendous speed--so much so, that it circles the entire\\r\\nearth every month. Now if the earth were absent the path of the moon\\r\\nwould be a straight line, say MB. If, however, the earth exerts\\r\\nattraction, the moon would be pulled inward. Instead of following\\r\\nthe line MB it would follow the curved path MB\\'. And again, the moon\\r\\nhaving arrived at B\\', is prevented from following the line B\\'C, but\\r\\nrather B\\'C\\'. So that the path instead of being a straight line tends\\r\\nto become curved. From Kepler\\'s researches the probabilities were that\\r\\nthis curve would assume the shape of an ellipse rather than a circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only reason, then, why the moon does not fall to the earth is on\\r\\naccount of its motion. Were it to stop moving even for the fraction\\r\\nof a second it would come straight down to us, and probably few would\\r\\nlive to tell the tale.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton reasoned that what keeps the moon revolving around the earth is\\r\\nthe gravitational pull of the latter. The next important step was to\\r\\ndiscover the law regulating this motion. Here Kepler\\'s observations of\\r\\nthe movements of the planets around the sun was of inestimable value;\\r\\nfor from these Newton deduced the hypothesis that attraction varies\\r\\ninversely as the square of the distance. Making use of this hypothesis,\\r\\nNewton calculated what the attractive power possessed by the earth must\\r\\nbe in order that the moon may continue in its path. He next compared\\r\\nthis force with the force exerted by the earth in pulling the apple\\r\\nto the ground, and found the forces to be identical! \"I compared,\"\\r\\nhe writes, \"the force necessary to keep the moon in her orb with the\\r\\nforce of gravity at the surface of the earth, and found them answer\\r\\npretty nearly.\" One and the same force pulls the moon and pulls the\\r\\napple--the force of gravity. Further, the hypothesis that the force\\r\\nof gravity varies inversely as the square of the distance had now\\r\\nreceived experimental confirmation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next step was perfectly clear. If the moon\\'s motion is controlled\\r\\nby the earth\\'s gravitational pull, why is it not possible that the\\r\\nearth\\'s motion, in turn, is controlled by the sun\\'s gravitational\\r\\npull? that, in fact, not only the earth\\'s motion, but the motion of\\r\\nall the planets is regulated by the same means?\\r\\n\\r\\nHere again Kepler\\'s pioneer work was a foundation comparable to\\r\\nreinforced concrete. Kepler, as we have seen, had shown that the earth\\r\\nrevolves around the sun in the form of an ellipse, one of the foci of\\r\\nthis ellipse being occupied by the sun. Newton now proved that such\\r\\nan elliptic path was possible only if the intensity of the attractive\\r\\nforce between sun and planet varied inversely as the square of the\\r\\ndistance--the very same relationship that had been applied with such\\r\\nsuccess in explaining the motion of the moon around the earth!\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton showed that the moon, the sun, the planets--every body in space\\r\\nconformed to this law. The earth attracts the moon; but so does the\\r\\nmoon the earth. If the moon revolves around the earth rather than the\\r\\nearth around the moon, it is because the earth is a much larger body,\\r\\nand hence its gravitational pull is stronger. The same is true of\\r\\nthe relationship existing between the earth and the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther Developments of Newton\\'s Law of Gravitation. When we speak of\\r\\nthe earth attracting the moon, and the moon the earth, what we really\\r\\nmean is that every one of the myriad particles composing the earth\\r\\nattracts every one of the myriad particles composing the moon, and\\r\\nvice versa. If in dealing with the attractive forces existing between\\r\\na planet and its satellite, or a planet and the sun, the power exerted\\r\\nby every one of these myriad particles would have to be considered\\r\\nseparately, then the mathematical task of computing such forces\\r\\nmight well appear hopeless. Newton was able to present the problem\\r\\nin a very simple form by pointing out that in a sphere such as the\\r\\nearth or the moon, the entire mass might be considered as residing\\r\\nin the center of the sphere. For purposes of computation, the earth\\r\\ncan be considered a particle, with its entire mass concentrated at\\r\\nthe center of the particle. This viewpoint enabled Newton to extend\\r\\nhis law of inverse squares to the remotest bodies in the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this great law of Newton\\'s found such general application beyond our\\r\\nplanet, it served an equally useful purpose in explaining a number of\\r\\npuzzling features on this planet. The ebb and flow of the tides was one\\r\\nof these puzzles. Even in ancient times it had been noticed that a full\\r\\nmoon and a high tide went hand in hand, and various mysterious powers,\\r\\nwere attributed to the satellite and the ocean. Newton pointed out that\\r\\nthe height of the water was a direct consequence of the attractive\\r\\npower of the moon, and, to a lesser extent, because further away,\\r\\nof the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of his first explanations, however, dealt with certain\\r\\nirregularities in the moon\\'s motion around the earth. If the solar\\r\\nsystem would consist of the earth and moon alone, then the path of the\\r\\nmoon would be that of an ellipse, with one of the foci of this ellipse\\r\\noccupied by the earth. Unfortunately for the simplicity of the problem,\\r\\nthere are other bodies relatively near in space, particularly that huge\\r\\nbody, the sun. The sun not only exerts its pull on the earth but also\\r\\non the moon. However, as the sun is much further away from the moon\\r\\nthan is the earth, the earth\\'s attraction for its satellite is much\\r\\ngreater, despite the fact that the sun is much huger and weighs far\\r\\nmore than the earth. The greater pull of the earth in one direction,\\r\\nand a lesser pull of the sun in another, places the poor moon between\\r\\nthe devil and the deep sea. The situation gives rise to a complexity of\\r\\nforces, the net result of which is that the moon\\'s orbit is not quite\\r\\nthat of an ellipse. Newton was able to account for all the forces that\\r\\ncome into play, and he proved that the actual path of the moon was\\r\\na direct consequence of the law of inverse squares in actual operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"Principia.\" The law of gravitation, embodying also laws of motion,\\r\\nwhich we shall discuss presently, was first published in Newton\\'s\\r\\nimmortal \"Principia\" (1686). A selection from the preface will disclose\\r\\nthe contents of the book, and, incidentally, the style of the author:\\r\\n\"... We offer this work as mathematical principles of philosophy; for\\r\\nall the difficulty in philosophy seems to consist in this--from the\\r\\nphenomena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from\\r\\nthese forces to demonstrate the other phenomena; and to this end the\\r\\ngeneral propositions in the first and second book are directed. In the\\r\\nthird book we give an example of this in the explication of the system\\r\\nof the world; for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated\\r\\nin the first book, we there derive from the celestial phenomena the\\r\\nforces of gravity with which bodies tend to the sun and the several\\r\\nplanets. Then, from these forces, by other propositions which are\\r\\nalso mathematical, we deduce the motions of the planets, the comets,\\r\\nthe moon and the sea. I wish we could derive the rest of the phenomena\\r\\nof nature by the same kind of reasoning from mechanical principles;\\r\\nfor I am induced by many reasons to suspect that they may all depend\\r\\nupon certain forces by which the particles of bodies, by some causes\\r\\nhitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards each other,\\r\\nand cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from each\\r\\nother....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point we may state that neither Newton, nor any of Newton\\'s\\r\\nsuccessors including Einstein, have been able to advance even a\\r\\nplausible theory as to the nature of this gravitational force. We\\r\\nknow that this force pulls a stone to the ground; we know, thanks\\r\\nto Newton, the laws regulating the motions due to gravity; but what\\r\\nthis force we call gravity really is we do not know. The mystery is\\r\\nas deep as the mystery of the origin of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Prof. Einstein,\" writes Prof. Eddington, \"has sought, and has not\\r\\nreached, any ultimate explanation of its [that is, gravitation]\\r\\ncause. A certain connection between the gravitational field and the\\r\\nmeasurement of space has been postulated, but this throws light rather\\r\\non the nature of our measurements than on gravitation itself. The\\r\\nrelativity theory is indifferent to hypotheses as to the nature of\\r\\ngravitation, just as it is indifferent to hypotheses as to the nature\\r\\nof light.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton\\'s Laws of Motion. In his Principia Newton begins with a series\\r\\nof simple definitions dealing with matter and force, and these are\\r\\nfollowed by his three famous laws of motion. The nature and amount\\r\\nof the effort required to start a body moving, and the conditions\\r\\nrequired to keep a body in motion, are included in these laws. The\\r\\nFundamentals, mass, time and space, are exhibited in their various\\r\\nrelationships. Of importance to us particularly is that in these laws,\\r\\ntime and space are considered as definite entities, and as two distinct\\r\\nand widely separated manifestations. We shall see that in Einstein\\'s\\r\\nhands a very close relationship between these two is brought about.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Newton and Einstein were led to their theory of gravitation\\r\\nby profound studies of the mathematics of motion, but as Newton\\'s\\r\\nconception of motion differed from Einstein\\'s, and as, moreover,\\r\\nimportant discoveries into the nature of matter and the relationship\\r\\nof motion to matter were made subsequent to Newton\\'s time, we need not\\r\\nwonder that the two theories show divergence; that, as we shall see,\\r\\nNewton\\'s is probably but an approximation of the truth. If we confine\\r\\nour attention to our own solar system, the deviation from Newton\\'s\\r\\nlaw is, as a rule, so small as to be negligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton\\'s laws of motion are really axioms, like the axioms of Euclid:\\r\\nthey do not admit of direct proof; but there is this difference,\\r\\nthat the axioms of Euclid seem more obviously true. For example,\\r\\nwhen Euclid informs us that \"things which are equal to the same\\r\\nthing are equal to one another,\" we have no hesitation in accepting\\r\\nthis statement, for it seems so self-evident. When, however, we are\\r\\ntold by Newton that \"the alteration of motion is ever proportional\\r\\nto the motive force impressed,\" we are at first somewhat bewildered\\r\\nwith the phraseology, and then, even when that has been mastered,\\r\\nthe readiness with which we respond will probably depend upon the\\r\\namount of scientific training we have received.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Every body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a\\r\\nstraight line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces\\r\\nimpressed thereon.\" So runs Newton\\'s first law of motion. A body does\\r\\nnot move unless something causes it to move; to make the body move\\r\\nyou must overcome the inertia of the body. On the other hand, if a\\r\\nbody is moving, it tends to continue moving, as witness our forward\\r\\nmovement when the train is brought to a standstill. It may be asked,\\r\\nwhy does not a bullet continue moving indefinitely once it has left\\r\\nthe barrel of the gun? Because of the resistance of the air which it\\r\\nhas to overcome; and the path of the bullet is not straight because\\r\\ngravity acts on it and tends to pull it downwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have no definite means of proving that a body once set in motion\\r\\nwould continue moving, for an indefinite time, and along a straight\\r\\nline. What Newton meant was that a body would continue moving provided\\r\\nno external force acted on it; but in actual practise such a condition\\r\\nis unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton\\'s first law defines force as that action necessary to change\\r\\na state of rest or of uniform motion, and tells us that force alone\\r\\nchanges the motion of a body. His second law deals with the relation\\r\\nof the force applied and the resulting change of motion of the body;\\r\\nthat is, it shows us how force may be measured. \"The alteration of\\r\\nmotion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed, and is made\\r\\nin the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton\\'s third law runs--\"To every action there is always opposed\\r\\nan equal reaction.\" The very fact that you have to use force means\\r\\nthat you have to overcome something of an opposite nature. The forward\\r\\npull of a horse towing a boat equals the backward pull of the tow-rope\\r\\nconnecting boat and horse. \"Many people,\" says Prof. Watson, \"find a\\r\\ndifficulty in accepting this statement ... since they think that if the\\r\\nforce exerted by the horse on the rope were not a little greater than\\r\\nthe backward force exerted by the rope on the horse, the boat would not\\r\\nprogress. In this case we must, however, remember that, as far as their\\r\\nrelative positions are concerned, the horse and the boat are at rest,\\r\\nand form a single body, and the action and reaction between them, due\\r\\nto the tension on the rope, must be equal and opposite, for otherwise\\r\\nthere would be relative motion, one with respect to the other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may well be asked, what bearing have these laws of Newton on the\\r\\nquestion of time and space? Simply this, that to measure force the\\r\\nfactors necessary are the masses of the bodies concerned, the time\\r\\ninvolved and the space covered; and Newton\\'s equations for measuring\\r\\nforces assume time and space to be quite independent of one another. As\\r\\nwe shall see, this is in striking contrast to Einstein\\'s view.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton\\'s Researches on Light. In 1665, when but 23 years old,\\r\\nNewton invented the binomial theorem and the infinitesimal calculus,\\r\\ntwo phases of pure mathematics which have been the cause of many a\\r\\nsleepless night to college freshmen. Had Newton done nothing else his\\r\\nfame would have been secure. But we have already glanced at his law\\r\\nof inverse squares and the law of gravitation. We now have to turn\\r\\nto some of Newton\\'s contributions to optics, because here more than\\r\\nelsewhere we shall find the starting point to a series of researches\\r\\nwhich have culminated so brilliantly in the work of Einstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton turned his attention to optics in 1666 when he proved that\\r\\nthe light from the sun, which appears white to us, is in reality a\\r\\nmixture of all the colors of the rainbow. This he showed by placing\\r\\na prism between the ray of light and a screen. A spectrum showing\\r\\nall the colors from red to violet appeared on the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother notable achievement of his was the design of a telescope which\\r\\nbrought objects to a sharp focus and prevented the blurring effects\\r\\nwhich had occasioned so much annoyance to Newton and his predecessors\\r\\nin all their astronomical observations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese and other discoveries of very great interest were brought\\r\\ntogether in a volume on optics which Newton published in 1704. Our\\r\\nparticular concern here is to examine the views advanced by him as\\r\\nto the nature of light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the nature of light should have been a subject for speculation\\r\\neven to the ancients need not surprise us. If other senses, as\\r\\ntouch, for example, convey impressions of objects, it is true to say\\r\\nthat the sense of sight conveys the most complete impression. Our\\r\\nconception of the external world is largely based upon the sense\\r\\nof sight; particularly so when we deal with objects beyond our\\r\\nreach. In astronomy, therefore, a study of the properties of light\\r\\nis indispensable. [1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what is this light? We open our eyes and we see; we close our eyes\\r\\nand we fail to see. At night in a dark room we may have our eyes open\\r\\nand yet we do not see; light, then, must be absent. Evidently, light\\r\\ndoes not wholly depend upon whether our eyes are open or closed. This\\r\\nmuch is certain: the eye functions and something else functions. What\\r\\nis this \"something else\"?\\r\\n\\r\\nStrangely enough, Plato and Aristotle regarded light as a property of\\r\\nthe eye and the eye alone. Out of the eye tentacles were shot which\\r\\nintercepted the object and so illuminated it. From what has already\\r\\nbeen said, such a view seems highly unlikely. Far more consistent with\\r\\ntheir philosophy in other directions would have been the theory that\\r\\nlight has its source in the object and not in the eye, and travels\\r\\nfrom object to eye rather than the reverse. How little substance the\\r\\nAristotelian contribution possesses is immediately seen when we refer\\r\\nto the art of photography. Here light rays produce effects which are\\r\\nindependent of any property of the eye. The blind man may click the\\r\\ncamera and produce the impression on the plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton, of course, could have fallen into no such error as did Plato\\r\\nand Aristotle. The source of light to him was the luminous body. Such\\r\\na body had the power of emitting minute particles at great speed,\\r\\nand these when coming in contact with the retina produce the sensation\\r\\nof sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis emission or corpuscular theory of Newton\\'s was combated\\r\\nvery strongly by his illustrious Dutch contemporary, Huyghens, who\\r\\nmaintained that light was a wave phenomenon, the disturbance starting\\r\\nat the luminous body and spreading out in all directions. The wave\\r\\nmotions of the sea offer a certain analogy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton\\'s strongest objection to Huyghens\\' wave theory was that it\\r\\nseemed to offer no satisfactory explanation as to why light travelled\\r\\nin straight lines. He says: \"To me the fundamental supposition itself\\r\\nseems impossible, namely that the waves or vibrations of any fluid can,\\r\\nlike the rays of light, be propagated in straight lines, without a\\r\\ncontinual and very extravagant bending and spreading every way into\\r\\nthe quiescent medium, where they are terminated by it. I mistake if\\r\\nthere be not both experiment and demonstration to the contrary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the corpuscular theory the particles emitted by the luminous\\r\\nbody were supposed to travel in straight lines. In empty space the\\r\\nparticles travelled in straight lines and spread in all directions. To\\r\\nexplain how light could traverse some types of matter--liquids, for\\r\\nexample--Newton supposed that these light particles travelled in the\\r\\nspaces between the molecules of the liquid.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton\\'s objection to the wave theory was not answered very\\r\\nconvincingly by Huyghens. Today we know that light waves of high\\r\\nfrequency tend to travel in straight lines, but may be prevented from\\r\\ndoing so by gravitational forces of bodies near its path. But this\\r\\nis Einstein\\'s discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very famous experiment by Foucault in 1853 proved beyond the shadow\\r\\nof a doubt that Newton\\'s corpuscular theory was untenable. According\\r\\nto Newton\\'s theory, the velocity of light must be greater in a denser\\r\\nmedium (such as water) than in a lighter one (such as air). According\\r\\nto the wave theory the reverse is true. Foucault showed that light\\r\\ndoes travel more slowly in water than in air. The facts were against\\r\\nNewton and in favor of Huyghens; and where facts and theory clash\\r\\nthere is but one thing to do: discard the theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Facts about Newton. Newton was a Cambridge man, and Newton made\\r\\nCambridge famous as a mathematical center. Since Newton\\'s day Cambridge\\r\\nhas boasted of a Clerk Maxwell and a Rayleigh, and her Larmor, her\\r\\nJ. J. Thomson and her Rutherford are still with us. Newton entered\\r\\nTrinity College when he was 18 and soon threw himself into higher\\r\\nmathematics. In 1669, when but 27 years old, he became professor of\\r\\nmathematics at Cambridge, and later represented that seat of learning\\r\\nin Parliament. When his friend Montague became Chancellor of the\\r\\nExchequer, Newton was offered, and accepted, the lucrative position\\r\\nof Master of the Mint. As president of the Royal Society Newton was\\r\\noccasionally brought in contact with Queen Anne. She held Newton in\\r\\nhigh esteem, and in 1705 she conferred the honor of knighthood on\\r\\nhim. He died in 1727.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know,\" wrote Newton, \"what I may appear to the world,\\r\\nbut, to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the\\r\\nseashore, and directing myself in now and then finding a smoother\\r\\npebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of\\r\\ntruth lay all undiscovered before me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the modesty of one whom many regard as the greatest intellect\\r\\nof all ages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREFERENCES\\r\\n\\r\\nAn excellent account of Newton may be found in Sir R. S. Ball\\'s Great\\r\\nAstronomers (Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons, Ltd., London). Sedgewick and\\r\\nTyler\\'s A Short History of Science (Macmillan, 1918) and Cajori\\'s\\r\\nA History of Mathematics (Macmillan, 1917) may also be consulted to\\r\\nadvantage.

This medium we call the ether. [2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuyghens\\' reasoning may be illustrated in some such way as this:\\r\\nIf a body moves a force pushes or pulls it. That force itself is\\r\\nexemplified in some kind of matter--say a horse. The horse in pulling\\r\\na cart is attached to the cart. The horse in pulling a boat may not be\\r\\nattached to the boat directly but to a rope, which in turn is attached\\r\\nto the boat. In common cases where one piece of matter affects another,\\r\\nthere is some direct contact, some go-between.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut cases are known where matter affects matter without affording us\\r\\nany evidence of contact. Take the case of a magnet\\'s attraction for\\r\\na piece of iron. Where is the rope that pulls the iron towards the\\r\\nmagnet? Perhaps you think the attraction due to the air in between the\\r\\nmagnet and iron? But removing the air does not stop the attraction. Yet\\r\\nhow can we conceive of the iron being drawn to the magnet unless there\\r\\nis some go-between? some medium not readily perceptible to the senses\\r\\nperhaps, and therefore not strictly a form of matter?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we can but picture some such medium we can imagine our magnet\\r\\ngiving rise to vibrations in this medium which are carried to the\\r\\niron. The magnet may give rise to a disturbance in that portion of the\\r\\nmedium nearest to it; then this portion hands over the disturbance\\r\\nto its neighbor, the next portion of the medium; and so on, until\\r\\nthe disturbance reaches the iron. You see, we are satisfying our\\r\\nsense-perception by arguing in favor of action by actual contact\\r\\nrather than some vague action at a distance; the go-between instead\\r\\nof being a rope is the medium called the ether.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoucault\\'s experiment completely shattered the corpuscular theory\\r\\nof light, and for want of any other more plausible alternative, we\\r\\nare thrown back on Huyghens\\' wave theory. It will presently appear\\r\\nthat this wave theory has elements in it which make it an excellent\\r\\nalternative. In the meantime, if light is to be considered as a wave\\r\\nmotion, then the query immediately arises, what is the medium through\\r\\nwhich these waves are propagated? If water is the medium for the waves\\r\\nof the sea, what is the medium for the waves of light? Again we answer,\\r\\nthe medium is the ether.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Is This \"Ether\"? Balloonists find conditions more and more\\r\\nuncomfortable the higher they ascend, for the density of the air\\r\\n(and therefore the amount of oxygen in a given volume of air) becomes\\r\\nless and less. Meteorologists have calculated that traces of the\\r\\nair we breathe may reach a height of some 200 miles. But what is\\r\\nbeyond? Nothing but the ether, it is claimed. Light from the sun and\\r\\nstars reaches us via the ether.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what is this ether? We cannot handle it. We cannot see it. It\\r\\nfails to fall within the scope of any of our senses, for every attempt\\r\\nto show its presence has failed. It is spirit-like in the popular\\r\\nsense. It is Lodge\\'s medium for the souls of the departed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHelmholtz and Kelvin tried to arrive at some properties of this\\r\\nhypothetical substance from a careful study of the manner in\\r\\nwhich waves were propagated through this ether. If, as the wave\\r\\ntheory teaches us, the ether can be set in motion, then according\\r\\nto laws of mechanics, the ether has mass. If so it is smaller in\\r\\namount than anything which can be detected with our most accurate\\r\\nbalance. Further--and this is a difficulty not easily explained--if\\r\\nthis ether has any mass, why does it offer no detectable resistance\\r\\nto the velocity of the planets in it? Why is not the velocity of\\r\\nthe planets reduced in time, just as the velocity of a rifle bullet\\r\\ndecreases owing to the resistance of the air?\\r\\n\\r\\nLodge, in arguing in favor of an ether, holds that its presence cannot\\r\\nbe detected because it pervades all space and all matter. His favorite\\r\\nanalogy is to point out the extreme unlikelihood of a deep-sea fish\\r\\ndiscovering the presence of the water with which it is surrounded on\\r\\nall sides;--all of which tells us nothing about the ether, but does\\r\\ntry to tell us why we cannot detect it. [3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, answering the query at the head of this paragraph, we may\\r\\nsay that we do not know.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaves Set up in This Ether. The waves are not all of the same\\r\\nlength. Those that produce the sensation of sight are not the smallest\\r\\nwaves known, yet their length is so small that it would take anywhere\\r\\nfrom one to two million of them to cover a yard. Curiously enough,\\r\\nour eye is not sensitive to wave lengths beyond either side of these\\r\\nlimits; yet much smaller, and much larger waves are known. The smallest\\r\\nare the famous X-rays, which are scarcely one ten-thousandth the size\\r\\nof light waves. Waves which have a powerful chemical action--those\\r\\nwhich act on a photographic plate, for example--are longer than\\r\\nX-rays, yet smaller than light waves. Waves larger than light waves\\r\\nare those which produce the sensation of heat, and those used in\\r\\nwireless telegraphy. The latter may reach the enormous length of 5,000\\r\\nyards. X-ray, actinic, or chemically active ray, light ray, heat ray,\\r\\nwireless ray--they differ in size, yet they all have this in common:\\r\\nthey travel with the same speed (186,000 miles per second).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Electromagnetic Theory of Light. Powerful support to the conception\\r\\nthat space is pervaded by ether was given when Maxwell discovered\\r\\nlight to be an electromagnetic phenomenon. From purely theoretical\\r\\nconsiderations this gifted English physicist was led to the view\\r\\nthat waves could be set up as a result of electrical disturbances. He\\r\\nproved that such waves would travel with the same velocity as light\\r\\nwaves. As air is not needed to transmit electrical phenomena--for you\\r\\ncan pump all air out of a system and produce a vacuum, and electrical\\r\\nphenomena will continue--Maxwell was forced to the conclusion that\\r\\nthe waves set up by electrical disturbances and transmitted with the\\r\\nsame velocity as light, were enabled to do so with the help of the\\r\\nsame medium as light, namely, the ether.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now but a step for Maxwell to formulate the theory that light\\r\\nitself is nothing but an electrical phenomenon, the sensation of light\\r\\nbeing due to the passage of electric waves through the ether. This\\r\\ntheory met with considerable opposition at first. Physicists had been\\r\\nbrought up in a school which had taught that light and electricity\\r\\nwere two entirely unrelated phenomena, and it was difficult for\\r\\nthem to loosen the shackles that bound them to the older school. But\\r\\ntwo startling discoveries helped to fasten attention upon Maxwell\\'s\\r\\ntheory. One was an experimental confirmation of Maxwell\\'s theoretical\\r\\ndeduction. Hertz, a pupil of Helmholtz, showed how the discharge from\\r\\na Leyden jar set up oscillations, which in turn gave rise to waves in\\r\\nthe ether, comparable, in so far as velocity is concerned, to light\\r\\nwaves, but differing from the latter in wave length, the Hertzian\\r\\nwaves being much longer. At a later date these waves were further\\r\\ninvestigated by Marconi, with the result that wireless messages soon\\r\\nbegan to be flashed from one place to another.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as there is a close connection between light and electricity,\\r\\nso there is between light and magnetism. The first to point out such\\r\\na relationship was the illustrious Michael Faraday, but we owe to\\r\\nZeeman the most extensive investigations in this field.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we throw some common salt into a flame, and, with the help of a\\r\\nspectroscope, examine the spectrum produced, we are struck by two\\r\\nbright lines which stand out very prominently. These lines, yellow\\r\\nin color, are known as the D-lines and serve to identify even minute\\r\\ntraces of sodium. What is true of sodium is true of other elements:\\r\\nthey all produce very characteristic spectra. Now Zeeman found that if\\r\\nthe flame is placed between a powerful magnet, and then some common\\r\\nsalt thrown into the flame, the two yellow lines give place to ten\\r\\nyellow lines. Such is one of the results of the effect of a magnetic\\r\\nfield on light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Electron. The \"Zeeman effect\" led to several theories regarding\\r\\nits nature. The most successful of these was one proposed by Larmor and\\r\\nmore fully treated by Lorentz. It has already been pointed out that the\\r\\nonly difference between wireless and light waves is that the former\\r\\nare much \"longer,\" and, we may now add, their vibrations are much\\r\\nslower. Light and wireless waves bear a relationship to one another\\r\\ncomparable to the relationship born by high and low-pitched sounds. To\\r\\nproduce wireless waves we allow a charge of electricity to oscillate\\r\\nto and fro. These oscillations, or oscillating charges, are the cause\\r\\nof such waves. What charges give rise to light waves? Lorentz, from\\r\\na study of the Zeeman effect, ascribed them to minute particles of\\r\\nmatter, smaller than the chemical atom, to which the name \"electron\"\\r\\nwas given.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unit of electricity is the electron. Electrons in motion give rise\\r\\nto electricity, and electrons in vibration, to light. The Zeeman effect\\r\\ngave Lorentz enough data to calculate the mass of such electrons. He\\r\\nthen showed that these electrons in a magnetic field would be disturbed\\r\\nby precisely the amount to which Zeeman\\'s observations pointed. In\\r\\nother words, the assumption of the electron fitted in most admirably\\r\\nwith Zeeman\\'s experiments on magnetism and light.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, a study of the discharge of electricity through\\r\\ngases, and, later, the discovery of radium, led, among other things,\\r\\nto a study of beta or cathode rays--negatively charged particles\\r\\nof electricity. Through a series of strikingly original experiments\\r\\nJ. J. Thomson ascertained the mass of such particles or corpuscles, and\\r\\nthen the very striking fact was brought out that Thomson\\'s corpuscle\\r\\nweighed the same as Lorentz\\'s electron. The electron was not merely\\r\\nthe unit of electricity but the smallest particle of matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nature of Matter. All matter is made up of some eighty-odd\\r\\nelements. Oxygen, copper, lead are examples of such elements. Each\\r\\nelement in turn consists of an innumerable number of atoms, of a size\\r\\nso small, that 300 million of them could be placed alongside of one\\r\\nanother without their total length exceeding one inch.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Dalton more than a hundred years ago postulated a theory, now\\r\\nknown as the atomic theory, to explain one of the fundamental laws\\r\\nin chemistry. This theory started out with an old Greek assumption\\r\\nthat matter cannot be divided indefinitely, but that, by continued\\r\\nsubdivision, a point would be reached beyond which no further breaking\\r\\nup would be possible. The particles at this stage Dalton called atoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nDalton\\'s atomic hypothesis became one of the pillars upon which the\\r\\nwhole superstructure of chemistry rested, and this because it explained\\r\\na number of perplexing difficulties so much more satisfactorily than\\r\\nany other hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor nearly a century Dalton stood as firm as a rock. But early\\r\\nin the nineties some epoch-making experiments on the discharge\\r\\nof electricity through gases were begun by a group of physicists,\\r\\nparticularly Crookes, Rutherford, Lenard, Roentgen, Becquerel, and,\\r\\nabove all, J. J. Thomson, which pointed very clearly to the fact that\\r\\nthe atoms are not the smallest particles of matter at all; that,\\r\\nin fact, they could be broken up into electrons, of a diameter one\\r\\none-hundred-thousandth that of an atom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt remained for the illustrious Madame Curie to confirm this beyond\\r\\nall doubt by her isolation of radium. Here, as Madame Curie showed,\\r\\nwas an element whose atoms were actually breaking up under one\\'s very\\r\\neyes, so to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far have we advanced since Dalton\\'s day, that Dalton\\'s unit,\\r\\nthe atom, is now pictured as a complex particle patterned after our\\r\\nsolar system, with a nucleus of positive electricity in the center,\\r\\nand particles of negative electricity, or electrons, surrounding\\r\\nthe nucleus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this leads to one inevitable conclusion: matter is electrical in\\r\\nnature. But now if matter and light have the same origin, and matter\\r\\nis subject to gravitation, why not light also? So reasoned Einstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummary. Newton\\'s studies of matter in motion led to his theory of\\r\\ngravitation, and, incidentally, to his conception of time and space\\r\\nas definite entities. As we shall see, Einstein in his theory of\\r\\ngravitation based it upon discoveries belonging to the post-Newtonian\\r\\nperiod. One of these is Minkowski\\'s theory of time and space as one\\r\\nand inseparable. This theory we shall discuss at some length in the\\r\\nnext chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther important discoveries which led up to Einstein\\'s work are the\\r\\nresearches which culminated in the electron theory of matter. The\\r\\norigin of this theory may be traced to studies dealing with the nature\\r\\nof light.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere again Newton appears as a pioneer. Newton\\'s corpuscular theory,\\r\\nhowever, proved wholly untenable when Foucault showed that the\\r\\nvelocity of light in water is less than in air, which is the very\\r\\nreverse of what the corpuscular theory demands, but which does agree\\r\\nwith Huyghens\\' wave theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Huyghens\\' wave theory postulated some medium in which the waves\\r\\ncan act. To this medium the name \"ether\" was given. However, all\\r\\nattempts to show the presence of such an ether failed. Naturally\\r\\nenough, some began to doubt the existence of an ether altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuyghens\\' wave theory received a new lease of life with Maxwell\\'s\\r\\ndiscovery that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon; that the waves\\r\\nset up by a source of light were comparable to waves set up by an\\r\\nelectrical disturbance.\\r\\n\\r\\nZeeman next showed that magnetism was also, closely related to light.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study of Zeeman\\'s experiments led Lorentz to the conclusion that\\r\\nelectrical phenomena are due to the motion of charged particles called\\r\\n\"electrons,\" and that the vibrations of these electrons give rise\\r\\nto light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conception of the electron as the very fundamental of matter was\\r\\narrived at in an entirely different way: from studies dealing with\\r\\nthe discharge of electricity through gases and the breaking up of\\r\\nthe atoms of radium.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf matter and light have the same origin, and if matter is subject\\r\\nto gravitation, why not light also?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREFERENCES\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the general subject of light the reader must be referred to a\\r\\nrather technical work, but one of the best in the English language:\\r\\nEdwin Edser, Light for Students (Macmillan, 1907).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nature of matter and electricity is excellently discussed in\\r\\nseveral books of a popular variety. The very best and most complete\\r\\nof its kind that has come to the author\\'s attention is Comstock and\\r\\nTroland\\'s The Nature of Matter and Electricity (D. Van Nostrand Co.,\\r\\n1919). Two other very readable books are Soddy\\'s Matter and Energy\\r\\n(Henry Holt and Co.) and Crehore\\'s The Mystery of Matter and Energy\\r\\n(D. Van Nostrand Co., 1917).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nEINSTEIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the most important result obtained in connection with the\\r\\ntheory of gravitation since Newton\\'s day. Einstein\\'s reasoning is\\r\\nthe result of one of the highest achievements of human thought.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words were uttered by Sir J. J. Thomson, the president of the\\r\\nRoyal Society, at a meeting of that body held on November 6, 1919,\\r\\nto discuss the results of the Eclipse Expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nEinstein another Newton--and this from the lips of J. J. Thomson,\\r\\nEngland\\'s most illustrious physicist! If ever man weighed words\\r\\ncarefully it is this Cambridge professor, whose own researches have\\r\\nassured him immortality for all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat has this Albert Einstein done to merit such extraordinary\\r\\npraise? With the world in turmoil, with classes and races in a death\\r\\nstruggle, with millions suffering and starving, why do we find time\\r\\nto turn our attention to this Jew? His ideas have no bearing on\\r\\nEurope\\'s calamity. They will not add one bushel of wheat to starving\\r\\npopulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is not hard to find. Men come and men go, but the mystery of\\r\\nthe universe remains. It is Einstein\\'s glory to have given us a deeper\\r\\ninsight into the universe. Our scientists are Huxley\\'s agnostics:\\r\\nthey do not deny activities beyond our planet; they merely center\\r\\ntheir attention on the knowable on this earth. Our philosophers,\\r\\non the other hand, go far afield. Some of them soar so high that,\\r\\nlike one poet\\'s opinion of Shelley, the bubble bursts. Einstein,\\r\\nusing the tools of the scientist--the experimentalist--builded a\\r\\nskyscraper which ultimately reached the philosophical school. His rôle\\r\\nis the rôle of alcohol in causing water and ether (the anæsthetic)\\r\\nto mix. Ether and water will mix no better than oil and water, without\\r\\nthe presence of alcohol; in its presence a uniform mixture is obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Object of the Eclipse Expedition. Einstein prophesied that a\\r\\nray of light passing near the sun would be pulled out of its course,\\r\\ndue to the action of gravity. He went even further. He predicted how\\r\\nmuch out of its course the ray would be deflected. This prediction\\r\\nwas based on a theory of gravitation which Einstein had developed in\\r\\ngreat mathematical detail. The object of the British Eclipse Expedition\\r\\nwas either to prove or disprove Einstein\\'s assumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Result of the Expedition. Einstein\\'s prophecy was fulfilled almost\\r\\nto the letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Significance of the Result. Since Einstein\\'s theory of gravitation\\r\\nis intimately associated with certain revolutionary ideas concerning\\r\\ntime and space, and, therefore, with Fundamentals of the Universe,\\r\\nthe net result of the expedition was to strengthen our belief in the\\r\\nvalidity of his new view of the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is our intention in the following pages to discuss the expedition\\r\\nand the larger aspects of Einstein\\'s theory that follow from it. But\\r\\nbefore we do so we must have a clear idea of our solar system.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Solar System. In the center of our system is the sun, a flaming\\r\\nmass of fire, much bigger than our own earth, and very, very far\\r\\naway. The sun has its family of eight planets--of which the earth is\\r\\none--which travel around the sun; and around some of the planets there\\r\\ntravel satellites, or moons. The earth has such a satellite, the moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we have good reasons for believing that every star which twinkles\\r\\nin the sky is a sun comparable to our own, having also its own planets\\r\\nand its own moons. These stars, or suns, are so much further away\\r\\nfrom us than our own sun, that but a speck of their light reaches us,\\r\\nand then only at night, when, as the poets would say, our sun has\\r\\ngone to its resting place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe distances between bodies in the solar system is so immense that,\\r\\nlike the number of dollars spent in the Great War, the number of miles\\r\\nconveys little, or no impression. But picture yourself in an express\\r\\ntrain going at the average rate of 30 miles an hour. If you start\\r\\nfrom New York and travel continuously you would reach San Francisco\\r\\nin 4 days. If you could continue your journey around the earth at\\r\\nthe same rate you would complete it in 35 days. If now you could\\r\\ntravel into space and to the moon, still with the same velocity,\\r\\nyou would reach it in 350 days. Having reached the moon, you could\\r\\ncircumscribe it with the same express train in 8 days, as compared to\\r\\nthe 35 days it would take you to circumscribe the earth. If instead\\r\\nof travelling to the moon you would book your passage for the sun\\r\\nyou, or rather your descendants, would get there in 350 years, and\\r\\nit would then take them 10 additional years to travel around the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmense as these distances are, they are small as compared to the\\r\\ndistances that separate us from the stars. It takes light which,\\r\\ninstead of travelling 30 miles an hour, travels 186,000 miles a second,\\r\\nabout 8 minutes to get to us from the sun, and a little over 4 years\\r\\nto reach us from the nearest star. The light from some of the other\\r\\nstars do not reach us for several hundred years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eclipse of the Sun. Now to return to an infinitesimal part of\\r\\nthe universe--our solar system. We have seen that the earth travels\\r\\naround the sun, and the moon around the earth. At some time in the\\r\\ncourse of these revolutions the moon must come directly between the\\r\\nearth and the sun. Then we get the eclipse of the sun. As the moon\\r\\nis smaller than the earth, only a portion of the earth\\'s surface\\r\\nwill be cut off from the sun\\'s rays. That portion which is so cut\\r\\noff suffers a total eclipse. This explains why the eclipse of May,\\r\\n1919, which was a total one for Brazil, was but a partial one for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nEinstein\\'s Assertion Re-stated. Einstein claimed that a ray of light\\r\\nfrom one of the stars, if passing near enough to the surface of the\\r\\nsun, would be appreciably deflected from its course; and he calculated\\r\\nthe exact amount of this deflection. To begin with, why should Einstein\\r\\nsuppose that the path of a ray of light would be affected by the son?\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton\\'s law of gravitation made it clear that bodies which have\\r\\nmass attract one another. If light has mass--and very recent work\\r\\ntends to show that it has--there is no reason why light should not be\\r\\nattracted by the sun, or any other planetary body. The question that\\r\\nagitated scientists was not so much whether a ray of light would be\\r\\ndeviated from its path, but to what extent this deviation would take\\r\\nplace. Would Einstein\\'s figures be confirmed?\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the bodies within our solar system the sun is by far the largest,\\r\\nand therefore it would exert a far greater pull than any of the planets\\r\\non light rays coming from the stars. Under ordinary conditions,\\r\\nhowever, the sun itself shines with such brilliancy, that objects\\r\\naround it, including rays of light passing near its surface, are wholly\\r\\ndimmed. Hence the necessity of putting our theory to the test only when\\r\\nthe moon covers up the sun--when there is a total eclipse of the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Graphical Representation. Imagine a star A, so selected that as\\r\\nits light comes to us the ray just grazes the sun. If the path of\\r\\nthe ray is straight--if the sun has no influence on it--then the path\\r\\ncan be represented by the line AB. If, however, the sun does exert a\\r\\ngravitational pull, then its real path will be AB\\', and to an observer\\r\\non the earth the star will have appeared to shift from A to A\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the Eclipse Expedition Set Out to Do. Photographs of stars\\r\\naround the sun were to be taken during the eclipse, and these\\r\\nphotographs compared with others of the same region taken at night,\\r\\nwith the sun absent. Any apparent shifting of the stars could be\\r\\ndetermined by measuring the distances between the stars as shown on\\r\\nthe photographic plates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree Possibilities Anticipated. According to Newton\\'s assumption,\\r\\nlight consists of corpuscles, or minute particles, emitted from\\r\\nthe source of light. If this be true these particles, having mass,\\r\\nshould be affected by the gravitational pull of the sun. If we apply\\r\\nNewton\\'s theory of gravitation and make use of his formula, it can be\\r\\nshown that such a gravitational pull would displace the ray of light\\r\\nby an average amount equal to 0.75 (seconds of angular distance.) [4]\\r\\nOn the other hand, where light is regarded as waves set in motion in\\r\\nthe \"ether\" of space (the wave theory of light), and where weight is\\r\\ndenied light altogether, no deviation need be expected. Finally there\\r\\nis a third alternative: Einstein\\'s. Light, says Einstein, has mass,\\r\\nand therefore probably weight. Mass is the matter light contains;\\r\\nweight represents pull by gravity. Light rays will be attracted by\\r\\nthe sun, but according to Einstein\\'s theory of gravitation the sun\\'s\\r\\ngravitational pull will displace the rays by an average amount equal\\r\\nto 1.75 (seconds of angular distance).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Expeditions. That science is highly international, despite many\\r\\nrecent examples to the contrary, is evidenced by this British Eclipse\\r\\nExpedition. Here was a theory propounded by one who had accepted a\\r\\nchair of physics in the university of Berlin, and across the English\\r\\nChannel were Germany\\'s mortal enemies making elaborate preparations\\r\\nto test the validity of the Berlin professor\\'s theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Astronomical Society began to plan the eclipse expedition\\r\\neven before the outbreak of the Great War. During the years that\\r\\nfollowed, despite the destinies of nations which hung on threads from\\r\\nday to day, despite the darkest hours in the history of the British\\r\\npeople, our English astronomers continued to give attention to the\\r\\ndetails of the proposed expedition. When the day of the eclipse came\\r\\nall was in readiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne expedition under Dr. Crommelin was sent to Sobral, Brazil; another,\\r\\nunder Prof. Eddington, to Principe, an island off the west coast of\\r\\nAfrica. In both these places a total eclipse was anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eclipse occurred on May 29, 1919. It lasted for six to eight\\r\\nminutes. Some 15 photographs, with an average exposure of five to six\\r\\nseconds, were taken. Two months later another series of photographs\\r\\nof the same region were taken, but this time the sun was no longer\\r\\nin the midst of these stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photographs were brought to the famous Greenwich Observatory,\\r\\nnear London, and the astronomers and mathematicians began their\\r\\nlaborious measurements and calculations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 6, at the meeting of the Royal Society, the result\\r\\nwas announced. The Sobral expedition reported 1.98; the Principe\\r\\nexpedition 1.62. The average was 1.8. Einstein had predicted 1.75,\\r\\nNewton might have predicted 0.75, and the orthodox scientists would\\r\\nhave predicted 0. There could now no longer be any question as to which\\r\\nof the three theories rested on a sure foundation. To quote Sir Frank\\r\\nDyson, the Astronomer Royal: \"After a careful study of the plates I am\\r\\nprepared to say that there can be no doubt that they confirm Einstein\\'s\\r\\nprediction. A very definite result has been obtained that light is\\r\\ndeflected in accordance with Einstein\\'s law of gravitation.\" [5]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere Did Einstein Get His Idea of Gravitation? In 1905 Einstein\\r\\npublished the first of a series of papers supporting and extending a\\r\\ntheory of time and space to which the name \"the theory of relativity\"\\r\\nhad been given. These views as expounded by Einstein came into direct\\r\\nconflict with Newton\\'s ideas of time and space, and also with Newton\\'s\\r\\nlaw of gravitation. Since Einstein had more faith in his theory of\\r\\nrelativity than in Newton\\'s theory of gravitation, Einstein so changed\\r\\nthe latter as to make it harmonize with the former. More will be said\\r\\non this subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet not the reader misunderstand. Newton was not wholly in the wrong;\\r\\nhe was only approximately right. With the knowledge existing in\\r\\nNewton\\'s day Newton could have done no more than he did; no mortal\\r\\ncould have done more. But since Newton\\'s day physics--and science in\\r\\ngeneral--has advanced in great strides, and Einstein can interpret\\r\\npresent-day knowledge in the same masterful fashion that Newton\\r\\ncould in his day. With more facts to build upon, Einstein\\'s law\\r\\nof gravitation is more universal than Newton\\'s; it really includes\\r\\nNewton\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now we must turn our attention very briefly to the theory of\\r\\nrelativity--the theory that led up to Einstein\\'s law of gravitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Theory of Relativity. The story goes that Einstein was led to\\r\\nhis ideas by watching a man fall from a roof. This story bears a\\r\\nstriking similarity to Newton and the apple. Perhaps one is as true\\r\\nas the other. [6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever that may be, the principle of relativity is as old as\\r\\nphilosophical thought, for it denies the possibility of measuring\\r\\nabsolute time, or absolute space. All things are relative. We say\\r\\nthat it takes a \"long time\" to get from New York to Albany; long as\\r\\ncompared to what? long, perhaps, as compared to the time it takes to\\r\\ngo from New York City to Brooklyn. We say the White House is \"large\";\\r\\nlarge when compared to a room in an apartment. But we can just as\\r\\nwell reverse our ideas of time and distance. The time it takes to go\\r\\nfrom New York to Albany is \"short\" when compared to the time it takes\\r\\nto go from New York to San Francisco. The size of the White House is\\r\\n\"small\" when compared to the size of the city of Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us take another illustration. Every time the earth turns on its\\r\\naxis we mark down as a day. With this as a basis, we say that it\\r\\ntakes a little over 365 days for the earth to complete its revolution\\r\\naround the sun, and our 365 days we call a year. But now consider some\\r\\nof our other planets. With our time as a basis, it takes Jupiter or\\r\\nSaturn 10 hours to turn on its axis, as compared to the 24 hours it\\r\\ntakes the earth to turn. Saturn\\'s day is less than one-half our day,\\r\\nand our day is more than twice Saturn\\'s--that is, according to the\\r\\ncalculations of the inhabitants of the earth. Mercury completes her\\r\\ncircuit around the sun in 88 days; Neptune, in 164 years. Mercury\\'s\\r\\nyear is but one-fourth ours, Neptune\\'s, 164 times ours. And observers\\r\\nat Mercury and Neptune would regard us from their standard of time,\\r\\nwhich differs from our standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may say, why not take our standard of time as the standard,\\r\\nand measure everything by it? But why should you? Such a selection\\r\\nwould be quite arbitrary. It would not be based on anything absolute,\\r\\nbut would merely depend on our velocity around the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese ideas are old enough in metaphysics. Einstein\\'s improvement\\r\\nof them consists not merely in speculating about them, but in giving\\r\\nthem mathematical form.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Origin of the Theory of Relativity. A train moves with reference\\r\\nto the earth. The earth moves with reference to the sun. We say the\\r\\nsun is stationary and the earth moves around the sun. But how do we\\r\\nknow that the sun itself does not move with reference to some other\\r\\nbody? How do we know that our planetary system, and the stars, and\\r\\nthe cosmos as a whole is not in motion?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no way of answering such a question unless we could get a\\r\\npoint of reference which is fixed--fixed absolutely in space.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have already alluded to our view of the nature of light, known as\\r\\nthe wave theory of light. This theory postulates the existence of an\\r\\nall-pervading \"ether\" in space. Light sets up wave disturbances in\\r\\nthis ether, and is thus propagated. If the ocean were the ether, the\\r\\nwaves of the ocean would compare with the waves set up by the ether.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what is this ether? It cannot be seen. It defies weight. It\\r\\npermeates all space. It permeates all matter. So say the exponents of\\r\\nthis ether. To the layman this sounds very much like another name\\r\\nfor the Deity. To Sir Oliver Lodge it represents the spirits of\\r\\nthe departed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo us, of importance is the conception that this ether is absolutely\\r\\nstationary. Such a conception is logical if the various developments in\\r\\noptics and electricity are considered. But if absolutely stationary,\\r\\nthen the ether is the long-sought-for point of reference, the guide\\r\\nto determine the motion of all bodies in the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Famous Experiment Performed by Prof. Michelson. If there is an\\r\\nether, and a stationary ether, and if the earth moves with reference to\\r\\nthis ether, the earth, in moving, must set up ether \"currents\"--just\\r\\nas when a train moves it sets up air currents. So reasoned Michelson,\\r\\na young Annapolis graduate at the time. And forthwith he devised a\\r\\ncrucial experiment the explanation of which we can simplify by the\\r\\nfollowing analogy:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich is the quicker, to swim up stream a certain length, say a\\r\\nhundred yards, and back again, or across stream the same length and\\r\\nback again? The swimmer will answer that the up-and-down journey is\\r\\nlonger. [7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOur river is the ether. The earth, if moving in this ether, will\\r\\nset up an ether stream, the up stream being parallel to the earth\\'s\\r\\nmotion. Now suppose we send a beam of light a certain distance up\\r\\nthis ether stream and back, and note the time; and then turn the\\r\\nbeam of light at right angles and send it an equal distance across\\r\\nthe stream and back, and note the time. How will the time taken for\\r\\nlight to travel in these two directions compare? Reasoning by analogy,\\r\\nthe up-and-down stream should take longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichelson\\'s results did not accord with analogy. No difference in time\\r\\ncould be detected between the beam of light travelling up-and-down,\\r\\nand across-and-back.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was contrary to all reason if the postulate of an ether was\\r\\nsound. Must we then revise our ideas of an ether? Perhaps after all\\r\\nthere is no ether.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if no ether, how are we to explain the propagation of light in\\r\\nspace, and various electrical phenomena connected with it, such as\\r\\nthe Hertzian, or wireless waves?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was another alternative, one suggested by Larmor in England\\r\\nand Lorentz in Holland,--that matter is contracted in the direction\\r\\nof its motion through the ether current. To say that bodies are\\r\\nactually shortened in the direction of their motion--by an amount\\r\\nwhich increases as the velocity of these bodies approaches that of\\r\\nlight--is so revolutionary an idea that Larmor and Lorentz would\\r\\nhardly have adopted such a viewpoint but for the fact that recent\\r\\ninvestigations into the nature of matter gave basis for such belief.\\r\\n\\r\\nMatter, it has been shown, is electrical in nature. The forces which\\r\\nhold the particles together are electrical. Lorentz showed that\\r\\nmathematical formulas for electrical forces could be developed which\\r\\nwould inevitably lead to the view that material bodies contract in\\r\\nthe direction of their motion. [8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this is ridiculous,\" you say; \"if I am shorter in one direction\\r\\nthan in another I would notice it.\" You would if some things were\\r\\nshortened and others were not. But if all things pointing in a certain\\r\\ndirection are shortened to an equal extent, how are you going to notice\\r\\nit? Will you apply the yard stick? That has been shortened. Will you\\r\\npass judgment with the help of your eyes? But your retina has also\\r\\ncontracted. In brief, if all things contract to the same amount it\\r\\nis as if there were no contraction at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nLorentz\\'s Plausible Explanation Really Deepens the Mystery. The\\r\\nstartling ideas just outlined have opened up several new vistas,\\r\\nbut they have left unanswered the two problems we set out to solve:\\r\\nwhether there is an ether, and if so, what is the velocity of the earth\\r\\nin reference to this ether? Lorentz maintains that there is an ether,\\r\\nbut the velocities of bodies relative to it must forever remain a\\r\\nmystery. As you change your position your distances change; you change;\\r\\neverything about you changes accordingly; and all basis for comparison\\r\\nis lost. Nature has entered into a conspiracy to keep you ignorant.\\r\\n\\r\\nEinstein Comes upon the Scene. Einstein starts with the assumption\\r\\nthat there is no possible way of identifying this ether. Suppose we\\r\\nignore the ether altogether, what then? [9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we do ignore the ether we no longer have any absolute point of\\r\\nreference; for if the ether is considered stationary the velocity of\\r\\nall bodies within the ether may be referred to it; any point in space\\r\\nmay be considered a fixed point. If, however, there is no ether, or if\\r\\nwe are to ignore it, how are we to get the velocity of bodies in space?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Principle of Relativity. If we are to believe in the \"causal\\r\\nrelationship between only such things as lie within the realm of\\r\\nobservation,\" then observation teaches us that bodies move only\\r\\nrelative to one another, and that the idea of absolute motion of a\\r\\nbody in space is meaningless. Einstein, therefore, postulates that\\r\\nthere is no such thing as absolute motion, and that all we can discuss\\r\\nis the relative motion of one body with respect to another. This\\r\\nis just as logical a deduction from Michelson\\'s experiment as the\\r\\nattempt to explain Michelson\\'s anomalous results in the light of an\\r\\nall-pervading ether.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider for a moment Newton\\'s scheme. This great pioneer pictured\\r\\nan absolute standard of position in space relative to which all\\r\\nvelocities are measured. Velocities were measured by noting the\\r\\ndistance covered and dividing the result by the time taken to cover\\r\\nthe distance. Space was a definite entity; and so was time. \"Time,\"\\r\\nsaid Newton, \"flows evenly on,\" independent of aught else. To Newton\\r\\ntime and space were entirely different, in no way to be confounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as Newton conceived of absolute space, so he conceived of absolute\\r\\ntime. From the latter standard of reference the idea of a \"simultaneity\\r\\nof events\" at different places arose. But now if there is no standard\\r\\nof reference, if the ether does not exist or does not function, if\\r\\ntwo points A and B cannot be referred to a third, and fixed point C,\\r\\nhow can we talk of \"simultaneity of events\" at A and B? [10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, Einstein shows that if all you can speak about is relative\\r\\nmotion, then one event which takes say one minute on one planet would\\r\\nnot take one minute on another. For consider two bodies in space,\\r\\nsay the planets Venus and the earth, with an observer B on Venus\\r\\nand another A on the earth. B notes the time taken for a ray of\\r\\nlight to travel from B to the distance M. A on the earth has means\\r\\nof observing the same event. B records one minute. A is puzzled,\\r\\nfor his watch records a little more than one minute. What is the\\r\\nexplanation? Granting that the two clocks register the same time\\r\\nto start with, and assuming further Einstein\\'s hypothesis that the\\r\\nvelocity of light is independent of its source, the difference in\\r\\ntime is due to the fact that the planet Venus moves with reference to\\r\\nthe observer on the earth; so that A in reality does not measure the\\r\\npath BM and MB, but BM\\' and M\\'B\\', where BB\\' represents the distance\\r\\nVenus itself has moved in the interval. And if you put yourself in B\\'s\\r\\nposition on Venus the situation is exactly reversed. All of which is\\r\\nsimply another way of saying that what is a certain time on one body\\r\\nin space is another time on another body in space. There is nothing\\r\\ndefinite in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nProf. Cohen\\'s Illustration. Further bewildering possibilities are\\r\\nclearly outlined in this apt illustration: \"If when you are going away\\r\\non a long and continuous journey you write home at regular intervals,\\r\\nyou should not be surprised that with the best possible mail service\\r\\nyour letters will reach home at progressively longer intervals,\\r\\nsince each letter will have a greater distance to travel than its\\r\\npredecessor. If you were armed with instruments to hear the home\\r\\nclock ticking, you would find that as your distance from home keeps\\r\\non increasing, the intervals between the successive ticks (that is,\\r\\nits seconds) grow longer, so that if you travelled with the velocity\\r\\nof sound the home clock would seem to slow down to a standstill--you\\r\\nwould never hear the next tick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely the same is true if you substitute light rays for sound\\r\\nwaves. If with the naked eye or with a telescope you watch a clock\\r\\nmoving away from you, you will find that its minute hand takes a longer\\r\\ntime to cover its five-minute intervals than does the chronometer in\\r\\nyour hand, and if the clock travelled with the velocity of light you\\r\\nwould forever see the minute hand at precisely the same point. That\\r\\nwhich is true of the clock is, of course, also true of all time\\r\\nintervals which it measures, so that if you moved away from the earth\\r\\nwith the velocity of light everything on it would appear as still as\\r\\non a painted canvas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYour time has apparently come to a standstill in one position and\\r\\nis moving in another! All this seems absurd enough, but it does show\\r\\nthat time alone has little meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nMinkowski\\'s Conclusion. The relativity theory requires that we\\r\\nthoroughly reorganise our method of measuring time. But this is\\r\\nintimately associated with our method of measuring space, the distance\\r\\nbetween two points. As we proceed we find that space without time has\\r\\nlittle meaning, and vice versa. This leads Minkowski to the conclusion\\r\\nthat \"time by itself and space by itself are mere shadows; they are\\r\\nonly two aspects of a single and indivisible manner of coordinating\\r\\nthe facts of the physical world.\" Einstein incorporated this time-space\\r\\nidea in his theory of relativity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow We Measure a Point in Space. Suppose I say to you that the chemical\\r\\nlaboratory of Columbia University faces Broadway; would that locate\\r\\nthe laboratory? Hardly, for any building along Broadway would face\\r\\nBroadway. But suppose I add that it is situated at Broadway and 117th\\r\\nStreet, south-east? there could be little doubt then. But if, further,\\r\\nthis laboratory would occupy but part of the building, say the third\\r\\nfloor; then the situation would be specified by naming Broadway,\\r\\n117th Street S. E., third floor. If Broadway represents length, 117th\\r\\nStreet width, and third floor height, we can see what is meant when we\\r\\nsay that three dimensions are required to locate a position in space.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fourth Dimension. A point on a line may be located by one\\r\\ndimension; a point on a wall requires two dimensions; a point in the\\r\\nroom, like the chemical laboratory above ground, needs three. The\\r\\nlayman cannot grasp the meaning of a fourth dimension; yet the\\r\\nmathematician does imagine it, and plays with it in mathematical\\r\\nterms. Minkowski and Einstein picture time as the fourth dimension. To\\r\\nthem time occupies no more important position than length, breadth,\\r\\nor thickness, and is as intimately related to these three as the three\\r\\nare to one another. H. G. Wells, the novelist, has beautifully caught\\r\\nthis spirit when in his novel, \"The Time Machine,\" he makes his hero\\r\\ntravel backwards and forwards along time just as a man might go north\\r\\nor south. When the man with his time machine goes forward he is in\\r\\nthe future; when he goes backwards he is in the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reality, if we stop to think a minute, there is no valid\\r\\nreason for the non-existence of a fourth dimension. If one, two\\r\\nand three dimensions, why not four--and five and six, for that\\r\\nmatter? Theoretically at least there is no reason why the limit\\r\\nshould be set at three. However, our minds become sluggish when we\\r\\nattempt to picture dimensions beyond three; just as an extraordinary\\r\\neffort on our part is needed to follow Einstein when he \"juggles\"\\r\\nwith space and time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur difficulty in imagining four dimensions may be likened to the\\r\\ndifficulty two-dimensioned beings would experience in imagining\\r\\nus, beings of the conventional three dimensions. Suppose these\\r\\ntwo-dimensional beings were living on the surface of the earth;\\r\\nwhat could they see? They could see nothing below and nothing above\\r\\nthe surface. They would see shifting surfaces as we walked about,\\r\\nbut being sensitive to length and breadth only, and not to height,\\r\\nthey could gain no notion whatsoever of what we really look like. It\\r\\nis thus with us when we attempt to picture four-dimensional space.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the analogy of the motion picture may help us somewhat. As\\r\\neverybody knows, these motion pictures consist of a series of\\r\\nphotographs which are shown in rapid succession on the screen. Each\\r\\nphotograph by itself conveys a sensation of space, that is, of three\\r\\ndimensions; but one photograph rapidly following another conveys\\r\\nthe sensation of space and time--four dimensions. Space and time\\r\\nare interlinked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Time-space Idea Further Developed. We have already alluded to the\\r\\nfact that objects in space moving with different velocities build up\\r\\ndifferent time intervals. Thus the velocity of the star Arcturus, if\\r\\ncompared with reference to the earth, moves at the rate of 200 miles a\\r\\nsecond. Its motion through space is different from ours. Objects which,\\r\\naccording to Lorentz, contract in the direction of their motion to an\\r\\nextent proportional to their velocity, will contract differently on\\r\\nthe surface of Arcturus than on the earth. Our space is not Arcturus\\'\\r\\nspace; neither is Arcturus\\' time our time. And what is true of the\\r\\ndiscrepancies existing between the space and time conceptions of the\\r\\nearth and Arcturus is true of any other two bodies in space moving\\r\\nat different velocities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut is there no relationship existing between the space and time\\r\\nof one body in the universe as compared to the space and time of\\r\\nanother? Can we not find something which holds good for all bodies\\r\\nin the universe? We can. We can express it mathematically. It is the\\r\\nconcept of time and space interlinked; of time as the fourth dimension,\\r\\nlength, breadth and thickness being the other three; of time as\\r\\none of four co-ordinates and at right angles to the other three\\r\\n(a situation which requires a terrific stretch of the imagination\\r\\nto visualize). The four dimensions are sufficient to co-ordinate\\r\\nthe time-space relationships of all bodies in the cosmos, and hence\\r\\nhave a universality which is totally lacking when time and space\\r\\nare used independently of one another. The four components of our\\r\\ntime-space are up-and-down, right-and-left, backwards-and-forwards,\\r\\nand sooner-and-later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strain\" and \"Distortion\" in Space. The four-dimensional unit has been\\r\\ngiven the name \"world-line,\" for the \"world-line\" of any particle in\\r\\nspace is in reality a complete history of that particle as it moves\\r\\nabout in space. Particles, we know, attract one another. If each\\r\\nparticle is represented by a world-line these world-lines will be\\r\\ndeflected from their course owing to such attraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine a bladder representing the universe, with lines on it\\r\\nrepresenting world-lines. Now squeeze the bladder. The world-lines are\\r\\nbent in various directions; they are \"distorted.\" This illustrates the\\r\\ninfluence of gravity on these world-lines; it is the \"strain\" brought\\r\\nabout due to the force of attraction. The distorted bladder illustrates\\r\\neven more, for it is a true representation of the real world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Einstein\\'s Conception of Time and Space Led to a New View of\\r\\nGravitation. In our conventional language we speak of the sun as\\r\\nexerting a \"force\" on the earth. We have seen, however, that this\\r\\nforce brings about a \"distortion\" or \"strain\" in world-lines; or,\\r\\nwhat amounts to the same thing, a \"distortion\" or \"strain\" of time\\r\\nand space. The sun\\'s \"force,\" the \"force\" of any body in space, is the\\r\\n\"force\" due to gravity; and these \"forces\" may now be treated in terms\\r\\nof the laws of time and space. \"The earth,\" Prof. Eddington tells us,\\r\\n\"moves in a curved orbit, not because the sun exerts any direct pull,\\r\\nbut because the earth is trying to find the shortest way through a\\r\\nspace and time which have been tangled up by an influence radiating\\r\\nfrom the sun.\" [11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point Newton\\'s conceptions fail, for his views and his laws\\r\\ndo not include \"strains\" in space. Newton\\'s law of gravitation must\\r\\nbe supplanted by one which does include such distortions. It is\\r\\nEinstein\\'s great glory to have supplied us with this new law.\\r\\n\\r\\nEinstein\\'s Law of Gravitation. This appears to be the only law\\r\\nwhich meets all requirements. It includes Newton\\'s law, and cannot be\\r\\ndistinguished from it if our experiments are confined to the earth and\\r\\ndeal with relatively small velocities. But when we betake ourselves\\r\\nto some orbits in space, with a gravitational pull much greater than\\r\\nthe earth\\'s, and when we deal with velocities comparable to that of\\r\\nlight, the differences become marked.\\r\\n\\r\\nEinstein\\'s Theory Scores Its First Great Victory. In the beginning\\r\\nof this chapter we referred to the elaborate eclipse expedition sent\\r\\nby the British to test the validity of Einstein\\'s new theory of\\r\\ngravitation. The British scientists would hardly have expended so\\r\\nmuch time and energy on this theory of Einstein\\'s but for the fact\\r\\nthat Einstein had already scored one great victory. What was it?\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine but a single planet revolving about the sun. According to\\r\\nNewton\\'s law of gravitation, the planet\\'s path would be that of an\\r\\nellipse--that is, oval--and the planet would travel indefinitely along\\r\\nthis path. According to Einstein the path would also be elliptical,\\r\\nbut before a revolution would be quite completed, the planet would\\r\\nstart along a slightly advanced line, forming a new ellipse slightly in\\r\\nadvance of the first. The elliptic orbit slowly turns in the direction\\r\\nin which the planet is moving. After many years--centuries--the orbit\\r\\nwill be in a different direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapidity of the orbit\\'s change of direction depends on the velocity\\r\\nof the planet. Mercury moving at the rate of 30 miles a second is the\\r\\nfastest among the planets. It has the further advantage over Venus or\\r\\nthe earth in that its orbit, as we have said, is an ellipse, whereas\\r\\nthe orbits of Venus and the earth are nearly circular; and how are\\r\\nyou going to tell in which direction a circle is pointing?\\r\\n\\r\\nObservation tells us that the orbit of Mercury is advancing at the\\r\\nrate of 574 seconds (of arc) per century. We can calculate how much\\r\\nof this is due to the gravitational influence of other planets. It\\r\\namounts to 532 seconds per century. What of the remaining 42 seconds?\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might be inclined to attribute this shortcoming to experimental\\r\\nerror. But when all such possibilities are allowed for our\\r\\nmathematicians assure us that the discrepancy is 30 times greater\\r\\nthan any possible experimental error.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis discrepancy between theory and observation remained one\\r\\nof the great puzzles in astronomy until Einstein cleared up the\\r\\nmystery. According to Einstein\\'s theory the mathematics of the\\r\\nsituation is simply this: in one revolution of the planet the orbit\\r\\nwill advance by a fraction of a revolution equal to three times the\\r\\nsquare of the ratio of the velocity of the planet to the velocity\\r\\nof light. When we allow mathematicians to work this out we get the\\r\\nfigure 43, which is certainly close enough to 42 to be called identical\\r\\nwith it.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill Another Victory? Einstein\\'s third prediction--the shifting of\\r\\nspectral lines toward the red end of the spectrum in the case of light\\r\\ncoming to us from the stars of appreciable mass--seems to have been\\r\\nconfirmed recently (March, 1920). \"The young physicists in Bonn,\"\\r\\nwrites Prof. Einstein to a friend, \"have now as good as certainty\\r\\n(so gut wie sicher) proved the red displacement of the spectral lines\\r\\nand have cleared up the grounds of a previous disappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSummary. Velocity, or movement in space, is at the basis of Einstein\\'s\\r\\nwork, as it was at the basis of Newton\\'s. But time and space no\\r\\nlonger have the distinct meanings that they had when examined with\\r\\nthe help of Newton\\'s equations. Time and space are not independent but\\r\\ninterdependent. They are meaningless when treated as separate entities,\\r\\ngiving results which may hold for one body in the universe but do not\\r\\nhold for any other body. To get general laws which are applicable to\\r\\nthe cosmos as a whole the Fundamentals of Mechanics must be united.\\r\\n\\r\\nEinstein\\'s great achievement consists in applying this\\r\\nrevised conception of space and time to elucidate cosmical\\r\\nproblems. \"World-lines,\" representing the progress of particles in\\r\\nspace, consisting of space-time combinations (the four dimensions),\\r\\nare \"strained\" or \"distorted\" in space due to the attraction that\\r\\nbodies exhibit for one another (the force of gravitation). On\\r\\nthe other hand, gravitation itself--more universal than anything\\r\\nelse in the universe--may be interpreted in terms of strains on\\r\\nworld-lines, or, what amounts to the same thing, strains of space-time\\r\\ncombinations. This brings gravitation within the field of Einstein\\'s\\r\\nconception of time and space.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Einstein\\'s conception of the universe is an improvement upon that\\r\\nof Newton\\'s is evidenced by the fact that Einstein\\'s law explains all\\r\\nthat Newton\\'s law does, and also other facts which Newton\\'s law is\\r\\nincapable of explaining. Among these may be mentioned the distortion\\r\\nof the oval orbits of planets round the sun (confirmed in the case of\\r\\nthe planet Mercury), and the deviation of light rays in a gravitational\\r\\nfield (confirmed by the English Solar Eclipse Expedition).\\r\\n\\r\\nEinstein\\'s Theories and the Inferences to be Drawn from\\r\\nThem. Einstein\\'s theories, supported as they are by very convincing\\r\\nexperiments, will probably profoundly influence philosophic and\\r\\nperhaps religious thought, but they can hardly be said to be of\\r\\nimmediate consequence to the man in the street. As I have said\\r\\nelsewhere, Einstein\\'s theories are not going to add one bushel of\\r\\nwheat to war-torn and devastated Europe, but in their conception of\\r\\na cosmos decidedly at variance with anything yet conceived by any\\r\\nschool of philosophy, they will attract the universal attention of\\r\\nthinking men in all countries. The scientist is immediately struck\\r\\nby the way Einstein has utilized the various achievements in physics\\r\\nand mathematics to build up a co-ordinated system showing connecting\\r\\nlinks where heretofore none were perceived. The philosopher is equally\\r\\nfascinated with a theory, which, in detail extremely complex, shows\\r\\na singular beauty of unity in design when viewed as a whole. The\\r\\nrevolutionary ideas propounded regarding time and space, the brilliant\\r\\nway in which the most universal property of matter, gravitation,\\r\\nis for the first time linked up with other properties of matter,\\r\\nand, above all, the experimental confirmation of several of his\\r\\nmore startling predictions--always the finest test of scientific\\r\\nmerit--stamps Einstein as one of those super-men who from time to\\r\\ntime are sent to us to give us a peep into the beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Facts about Einstein Himself. Albert Einstein was born in Germany\\r\\nsome 45 years ago. At first he was engaged at the Patent Bureau in\\r\\nBerne, and later became professor at the Zürich Polytechnic. After\\r\\na short stay at Prague University he accepted one of those tempting\\r\\n\"Akademiker\" professorships at the university of Berlin--professorships\\r\\nwhich insure a comfortable income to the recipient of one of them,\\r\\nlittle university work beyond, perhaps, one lecture a week, and\\r\\nsplendid facilities for research. A similar inducement enticed the\\r\\nchemical philosopher, Van \\'t Hoff, to leave his Amsterdam, and the\\r\\nSwedes came perilously near losing their most illustrious scientist,\\r\\nArrhenius.\\r\\n\\r\\nEinstein published his first paper on relativity in 1905, when not\\r\\nmore than 30 years old. Of this paper Planck, the Nobel Laureate\\r\\nin physics this year, has offered this opinion: \"It surpasses in\\r\\nboldness everything previously suggested in speculative natural\\r\\nphilosophy and even in the philosophical theories of knowledge. The\\r\\nrevolution introduced into the physical conceptions of the world is\\r\\nonly to be compared in extent and depth with that brought about by\\r\\nthe introduction of the Copernican system of the universe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEinstein published a full exposition of the relativity theory in 1916.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the momentous years of 1914-19, Einstein quietly pursued his\\r\\nlabors. There seems to be some foundation for the belief that the ways\\r\\nof the German High Command found little favor in his eyes. At any\\r\\nrate, he was not one of the forty professors who signed the famous\\r\\nmanifesto extolling Germany\\'s aims. \"We know for a fact,\" writes\\r\\nDr. O. A. Rankine, of the Imperial College of Science and Technology,\\r\\nLondon, \"that Einstein never was employed on war work. Whatever may\\r\\nhave been Germany\\'s mistakes in other directions, she left her men\\r\\nof science severely alone. In fact, they were encouraged to continue\\r\\nin their normal occupations. Einstein undoubtedly received a large\\r\\nmeasure of support from the Imperial Government, even when the German\\r\\narmies were being driven back across Belgium.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nQuite recently (June, 1920) the Barnard Medal of Columbia University\\r\\nwas conferred on him \"in recognition of his highly original\\r\\nand fruitful development of the fundamental concepts of physics\\r\\nthrough application of mathematics.\" In acknowledging the honor,\\r\\nProf. Einstein wrote to President Butler that \"... quite apart from\\r\\nthe personal satisfaction, I believe I may regard your decision [to\\r\\nconfer the medal upon him] as a harbinger of a better time in which\\r\\na sense of international solidarity will once more unite scholars of\\r\\nthe various countries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREFERENCES\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those lacking all astronomical knowledge, an excellent plan would\\r\\nbe to read the first 40 pages of W. H. Snyder\\'s Everyday Science\\r\\n(Allyn and Bacon), in which may be found a clear and simple account\\r\\nof the solar system. This could be followed with Bertrand Russell\\'s\\r\\nchapter on The Nature of Matter in his little volume, The Problems of\\r\\nPhilosophy (Henry Holt and Co.).

Witness the\\r\\nfollowing statement he made recently before a New York audience:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To my mind the ether of space is a substantial reality with\\r\\nextraordinarily perfect properties, with an immense amount of energy\\r\\nstored up in it, with a constitution which we must discover, but a\\r\\nsubstantial reality far more impressive than that of matter. Empty\\r\\nspace, as we call it, is full of ether, but it makes no appeal to\\r\\nour senses. The appearance is as if it were nothing. It is the most\\r\\nimportant thing in the material universe. I believe that matter\\r\\nis a modification of ether, a very porous substance, a thing more\\r\\nanalogous to a cobweb or the Milky Way or something very slight and\\r\\nunsubstantial, as compared to ether.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The properties of ether seem to be perfect. Matter is less so; it has\\r\\nfriction and elasticity. No imperfection has been discovered in the\\r\\nether space. It doesn\\'t wear out; there is no dissipation of energy;\\r\\nthere is no friction. Ether is material, yet it is not matter; both\\r\\nare substantial realities in physics, but it is the ether of space\\r\\nthat holds things together and acts as a cement. My business is to\\r\\ncall attention to the whole world of etherealness of things, and I\\r\\nhave made it a subject of thirty years\\' study, but we must admit that\\r\\nthere is no getting hold of ether except indirectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I consider the ether of space,\" says Lodge, in conclusion, \"the one\\r\\nsubstantial thing in the universe.\" And Lodge is certainly entitled\\r\\nto his opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote 4 (page 51)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the benefit of those readers who wish to gain a deeper insight\\r\\ninto the relativity principle, we shall here discuss it very briefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton and Galileo had developed a relativity principle in mechanics\\r\\nwhich may be stated as follows: If one system of reference is in\\r\\nuniform rectilinear motion with respect to another system of reference,\\r\\nthen whatever physical laws are deduced from the first system hold\\r\\ntrue for the second system. The two systems are equivalent. If the\\r\\ntwo systems be represented by $xyz$ and $x\\'y\\'z\\'$, and if they move\\r\\nwith the velocity of v along the x-axis with respect to one another,\\r\\nthen the two systems are mathematically related thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n    $$x\\' = x - vt, y\\' = y, z\\' = z, t\\' = t,$$\\r\\n\\r\\nand this immediately provides us with a means of transforming the\\r\\nlaws of one system to those of another.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the development of electrodynamics (which we may call electricity\\r\\nin motion) difficulties arose which equations in mechanics of type\\r\\n(1) could no longer solve. These difficulties merely increased when\\r\\nMaxwell showed that light must be regarded as an electromagnetic\\r\\nphenomenon. For suppose we wish to investigate the motion of a source\\r\\nof light (which may be the equivalent of the motion of the earth\\r\\nwith reference to the sun) with respect to the velocity of the light\\r\\nit emits--a typical example of the study of moving systems--how are\\r\\nwe to coordinate the electrodynamical and mechanical elements? Or,\\r\\nagain, suppose we wish to investigate the velocity of electrons shot\\r\\nout from radium with a speed comparable to that of light, how are we\\r\\nto coordinate the two branches in tracing the course of these negative\\r\\nparticles of electricity?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was difficulties such as these that led to the Lorentz-Einstein\\r\\nmodifications of the Newton-Galileo relativity equations (1). The\\r\\nLorentz-Einstein equations are expressed in the form:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$x\\' = \\\\frac{x-vt}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^2}{c}}}, y\\' = y, z\\' = z, t\\' =\\r\\n\\\\frac{t-\\\\frac{v}{c^2}\\\\cdot x}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}},$$\\r\\n\\r\\nc denoting the velocity of light in vacuo (which, according to all\\r\\nobservations, is the same, irrespective of the observer\\'s state of\\r\\nmotion). Here, you see, electrodynamical systems (light and therefore\\r\\n\"ray\" velocities such as those due to electrons) are brought into play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis gives us Einstein\\'s special theory of relativity. From it Einstein\\r\\ndeduced some startling conceptions of time and space.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote 5 (page 55)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe velocity (v) of an object in one system will have a different\\r\\nvelocity (v\\') if referred to another system in uniform motion relative\\r\\nto the first. It had been supposed that only a \"something\" endowed\\r\\nwith infinite velocity would show the same velocity in all systems,\\r\\nirrespective of the motions of the latter. Michelson and Morley\\'s\\r\\nresults actually point to the velocity of light as showing the\\r\\nproperties of the imaginary \"infinite velocity.\" The velocity of\\r\\nlight possesses universal significance; and this is the basis for\\r\\nmuch of Einstein\\'s earlier work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote 6 (page 56)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Euclid assumes that parallel lines never meet, which they cannot\\r\\ndo of course if they be defined as equidistant. But are there such\\r\\nlines? And if not, why not assume that all lines drawn through a\\r\\npoint outside a given line will eventually intersect it? Such an\\r\\nassumption leads to a geometry in which all lines are conceived as\\r\\nbeing drawn on the surface of a sphere or an ellipse, and in it the\\r\\nthree angles of a triangle are never quite equal to two right angles,\\r\\nnor the circumference of a circle quite [pi] times its diameter. But\\r\\nthat is precisely what the contraction effect due to motion requires.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    (Dr. Walker)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote 7 (page 57)\\r\\n\\r\\nEinstein had become tired of assumptions. He had no particular\\r\\nobjection to the \"ether\" theory beyond the fact that this \"ether\"\\r\\ndid not come within the range of our senses; it could not be\\r\\n\"observed.\" \"The consistent fulfilment of the two postulates--\\'action\\r\\nby contact\\' and causal relationship between only such things\\r\\nas lie within the realm of observation [see Note 2] combined\\r\\ntogether is, I believe, the mainspring of Einstein\\'s method of\\r\\ninvestigation....\" (Prof. Freundlich).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote 8 (page 59)\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the conception of the \"simultaneity\" of events is devoid of\\r\\nmeaning can be deduced from equation (2) [see Note 4]. We owe the proof\\r\\nto Einstein. \"It is possible to select a suitable time-coordinate\\r\\nin such a way that a time-measurement enters into physical laws\\r\\nin exactly the same manner as regards its significance as a space\\r\\nmeasurement (that is, they are fully equivalent symbolically), and\\r\\nhas likewise a definite coordinate direction.... It never occurred to\\r\\nanyone that the use of a light-signal as a means of connection between\\r\\nthe moving-body and the observer, which is necessary in practice in\\r\\norder to determine simultaneity, might affect the final result, i.e.,\\r\\nof time measurements in different systems.\" (Freundlich). But that\\r\\nis just what Einstein shows, because time-measurements are based on\\r\\n\"simultaneity of events,\" and this, as pointed out above, is devoid\\r\\nof meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad the older masters the occasion to study enormous velocities, such\\r\\nas the velocity of light, rather than relatively small ones--and even\\r\\nthe velocity of the earth around the sun is small as compared to the\\r\\nvelocity of light--discrepancies between theory and experiment would\\r\\nhave become apparent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote 9 (page 67)\\r\\n\\r\\nHow the special theory of relativity (see Note 4) led to the general\\r\\ntheory of relativity (which included gravitation) may now be briefly\\r\\ntraced.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we speak of electrons, or negative particles of electricity,\\r\\nin motion, we are speaking of energy in motion. Now these electrons\\r\\nwhen in motion exhibit properties that are very similar to matter in\\r\\nmotion. Whatever deviations there are are due to the enormous velocity\\r\\nof these electrons, and this velocity, as has already been pointed\\r\\nout, is comparable to that of light; whereas before the advent of the\\r\\nelectron, the velocity of no particles comparable to that of light\\r\\nhad ever been measured.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to present views \"all inertia of matter consists only of the\\r\\ninertia of the latent energy in it; ... everything that we know of the\\r\\ninertia of energy holds without exception for the inertia of matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it is on the assumption that inertial mass and gravitational\\r\\n\"pull\" are equivalent that the mass of a body is determined by its\\r\\nweight. What is true of matter should be true of energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe special theory of relativity, however, takes into account only\\r\\ninertia (\"inertial mass\") but not gravitation (gravitational pull or\\r\\nweight) of energy. When a body absorbs energy equation 2 (see Note 4)\\r\\nwill record a gain in inertia but not in weight--which is contrary\\r\\nto one of the fundamental facts in mechanics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means that a more general theory of relativity is required to\\r\\ninclude gravitational phenomena. Hence Einstein\\'s General Theory of\\r\\nRelativity. Hence the approach to a new theory of gravitation. Hence\\r\\n\"the setting up of a differential equation which comprises the\\r\\nmotion of a body under the influence of both inertia and gravity,\\r\\nand which symbolically expresses the relativity of motions.... The\\r\\ndifferential law must always preserve the same form, irrespective of\\r\\nthe system of coordinates to which it is referred, so that no system of\\r\\ncoordinates enjoys a preference to any other.\" (For the general form\\r\\nof the equation and for an excellent discussion of its significance,\\r\\nsee Freundlich\\'s monograph, pages 27-33.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTIME, SPACE, AND GRAVITATION [14]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Prof. Albert Einstein\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several kinds of theory in physics. Most of them are\\r\\nconstructive. These attempt to build a picture of complex phenomena out\\r\\nof some relatively simple proposition. The kinetic theory of gases,\\r\\nfor instance, attempts to refer to molecular movement the mechanical\\r\\nthermal, and diffusional properties of gases. When we say that we\\r\\nunderstand a group of natural phenomena, we mean that we have found\\r\\na constructive theory which embraces them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheories of Principle.--But in addition to this most weighty group of\\r\\ntheories, there is another group consisting of what I call theories of\\r\\nprinciple. These employ the analytic, not the synthetic method. Their\\r\\nstarting-point and foundation are not hypothetical constituents, but\\r\\nempirically observed general properties of phenomena, principles from\\r\\nwhich mathematical formulæ are deduced of such a kind that they apply\\r\\nto every case which presents itself. Thermodynamics, for instance,\\r\\nstarting from the fact that perpetual motion never occurs in ordinary\\r\\nexperience, attempts to deduce from this, by analytic processes,\\r\\na theory which will apply in every case. The merit of constructive\\r\\ntheories is their comprehensiveness, adaptability, and clarity,\\r\\nthat of the theories of principle, their logical perfection, and the\\r\\nsecurity of their foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theory of relativity is a theory of principle. To understand it,\\r\\nthe principles on which it rests must be grasped. But before stating\\r\\nthese it is necessary to point out that the theory of relativity is\\r\\nlike a house with two separate stories, the special relativity theory\\r\\nand the general theory of relativity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the time of the ancient Greeks it has been well known that in\\r\\ndescribing the motion of a body we must refer to another body. The\\r\\nmotion of a railway train is described with reference to the ground,\\r\\nof a planet with reference to the total assemblage of visible fixed\\r\\nstars. In physics the bodies to which motions are spatially referred\\r\\nare termed systems of coordinates. The laws of mechanics of Galileo\\r\\nand Newton can be formulated only by using a system of coordinates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state of motion of a system of coordinates can not be chosen\\r\\narbitrarily if the laws of mechanics are to hold good (it must be\\r\\nfree from twisting and from acceleration). The system of coordinates\\r\\nemployed in mechanics is called an inertia-system. The state of\\r\\nmotion of an inertia-system, so far as mechanics are concerned,\\r\\nis not restricted by nature to one condition. The condition in the\\r\\nfollowing proposition suffices; a system of coordinates moving in the\\r\\nsame direction and at the same rate as a system of inertia is itself\\r\\na system of inertia. The special relativity theory is therefore the\\r\\napplication of the following proposition to any natural process:\\r\\n\"Every law of nature which holds good with respect to a coordinate\\r\\nsystem K must also hold good for any other system K\\' provided that\\r\\nK and K\\' are in uniform movement of translation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second principle on which the special relativity theory rests is\\r\\nthat of the constancy of the velocity of light in a vacuum. Light\\r\\nin a vacuum has a definite and constant velocity, independent of\\r\\nthe velocity of its source. Physicists owe their confidence in this\\r\\nproposition to the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electro-dynamics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two principles which I have mentioned have received strong\\r\\nexperimental confirmation, but do not seem to be logically\\r\\ncompatible. The special relativity theory achieved their logical\\r\\nreconciliation by making a change in kinematics, that is to say,\\r\\nin the doctrine of the physical laws of space and time. It became\\r\\nevident that a statement of the coincidence of two events could have\\r\\na meaning only in connection with a system of coordinates, that the\\r\\nmass of bodies and the rate of movement of clocks must depend on\\r\\ntheir state of motion with regard to the coordinates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Older Physics.--But the older physics, including the laws of\\r\\nmotion of Galileo and Newton, clashed with the relativistic kinematics\\r\\nthat I have indicated. The latter gave origin to certain generalized\\r\\nmathematical conditions with which the laws of nature would have to\\r\\nconform if the two fundamental principles were compatible. Physics had\\r\\nto be modified. The most notable change was a new law of motion for\\r\\n(very rapidly) moving mass-points, and this soon came to be verified\\r\\nin the case of electrically-laden particles. The most important result\\r\\nof the special relativity system concerned the inert mass of a material\\r\\nsystem. It became evident that the inertia of such a system must depend\\r\\non its energy-content, so that we were driven to the conception that\\r\\ninert mass was nothing else than latent energy. The doctrine of the\\r\\nconservation of mass lost its independence and became merged in the\\r\\ndoctrine of conservation of energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe special relativity theory which was simply a systematic extension\\r\\nof the electro-dynamics of Maxwell and Lorentz, had consequences which\\r\\nreached beyond itself. Must the independence of physical laws with\\r\\nregard to a system of coordinates be limited to systems of coordinates\\r\\nin uniform movement of translation with regard to one another? What has\\r\\nnature to do with the coordinate systems that we propose and with their\\r\\nmotions? Although it may be necessary for our descriptions of nature\\r\\nto employ systems of coordinates that we have selected arbitrarily,\\r\\nthe choice should not be limited in any way so far as their state of\\r\\nmotion is concerned. (General theory of relativity.) The application\\r\\nof this general theory of relativity was found to be in conflict\\r\\nwith a well-known experiment, according to which it appeared that\\r\\nthe weight and the inertia of a body depended on the same constants\\r\\n(identity of inert and heavy masses). Consider the case of a system of\\r\\ncoordinates which is conceived as being in stable rotation relative\\r\\nto a system of inertia in the Newtonian sense. The forces which,\\r\\nrelatively to this system, are centrifugal must, in the Newtonian\\r\\nsense, be attributed to inertia. But these centrifugal forces are,\\r\\nlike gravitation, proportional to the mass of the bodies. Is it not,\\r\\nthen, possible to regard the system of coordinates as at rest, and\\r\\nthe centrifugal forces as gravitational? The interpretation seemed\\r\\nobvious, but classical mechanics forbade it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis slight sketch indicates how a generalized theory of relativity\\r\\nmust include the laws of gravitation, and actual pursuit of the\\r\\nconception has justified the hope. But the way was harder than\\r\\nwas expected, because it contradicted Euclidian geometry. In other\\r\\nwords, the laws according to which material bodies are arranged in\\r\\nspace do not exactly agree with the laws of space prescribed by the\\r\\nEuclidian geometry of solids. This is what is meant by the phrase\\r\\n\"a warp in space.\" The fundamental concepts \"straight,\" \"plane,\"\\r\\netc., accordingly lose their exact meaning in physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the generalized theory of relativity, the doctrine of space and\\r\\ntime, kinematics, is no longer one of the absolute foundations of\\r\\ngeneral physics. The geometrical states of bodies and the rates\\r\\nof clocks depend in the first place on their gravitational fields,\\r\\nwhich again are produced by the material system concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the new theory of gravitation diverges widely from that of Newton\\r\\nwith respect to its basal principle. But in practical application\\r\\nthe two agree so closely that it has been difficult to find cases in\\r\\nwhich the actual differences could be subjected to observation. As\\r\\nyet only the following have been suggested:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The distortion of the oval orbits of planets round the sun\\r\\n(confirmed in the case of the planet Mercury).\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The deviation of light-rays in a gravitational field (confirmed\\r\\nby the English Solar Eclipse expedition).\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The shifting of spectral lines towards the red end of the spectrum\\r\\nin the case of light coming to us from stars of appreciable mass\\r\\n(not yet confirmed).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great attraction of the theory is its logical consistency. If\\r\\nany deduction from it should prove untenable, it must be given up. A\\r\\nmodification of it seems impossible without destruction of the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one must think that Newton\\'s great creation can be overthrown in\\r\\nany real sense by this or by any other theory. His clear and wide\\r\\nideas will for ever retain their significance as the foundation on\\r\\nwhich our modern conceptions of physics have been built.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEINSTEIN\\'S LAW OF GRAVITATION [15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Prof. J. S. Ames\\r\\nJohns Hopkins University\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n... In the treatment of Maxwell\\'s equations of the electromagnetic\\r\\nfield, several investigators realized the importance of deducing the\\r\\nform of the equations when applied to a system moving with a uniform\\r\\nvelocity. One object of such an investigation would be to determine\\r\\nsuch a set of transformation formulæ as would leave the mathematical\\r\\nform of the equations unaltered. The necessary relations between\\r\\nthe new space-coordinates, those applying to the moving system,\\r\\nand the original set were of course obvious; and elementary methods\\r\\nled to the deduction of a new variable which should replace the time\\r\\ncoordinate. This step was taken by Lorentz and also, I believe, by\\r\\nLarmor and by Voigt. The mathematical deductions and applications\\r\\nin the hands of these men were extremely beautiful, and are probably\\r\\nwell known to you all.\\r\\n\\r\\nLorentz\\' paper on this subject appeared in the Proceedings of the\\r\\nAmsterdam Academy in 1904. In the following year there was published\\r\\nin the Annalen der Physik a paper by Einstein, written without any\\r\\nknowledge of the work of Lorentz, in which he arrived at the same\\r\\ntransformation equations as did the latter, but with an entirely\\r\\ndifferent and fundamentally new interpretation. Einstein called\\r\\nattention in his paper to the lack of definiteness in the concepts\\r\\nof time and space, as ordinarily stated and used. He analyzed clearly\\r\\nthe definitions and postulates which were necessary before one could\\r\\nspeak with exactness of a length or of an interval of time. He disposed\\r\\nforever of the propriety of speaking of the \"true\" length of a rod or\\r\\nof the \"true\" duration of time, showing, in fact, that the numerical\\r\\nvalues which we attach to lengths or intervals of time depend upon the\\r\\ndefinitions and postulates which we adopt. The words \"absolute\" space\\r\\nor time intervals are devoid of meaning. As an illustration of what\\r\\nis meant Einstein discussed two possible ways of measuring the length\\r\\nof a rod when it is moving in the direction of its own length with\\r\\na uniform velocity, that is, after having adopted a scale of length,\\r\\ntwo ways of assigning a number to the length of the rod concerned. One\\r\\nmethod is to imagine the observer moving with the rod, applying along\\r\\nits length the measuring scale, and reading off the positions of the\\r\\nends of the rod. Another method would be to have two observers at rest\\r\\non the body with reference to which the rod has the uniform velocity,\\r\\nso stationed along the line of motion of the rod that as the rod\\r\\nmoves past them they can note simultaneously on a stationary measuring\\r\\nscale the positions of the two ends of the rod. Einstein showed that,\\r\\naccepting two postulates which need no defense at this time, the two\\r\\nmethods of measurements would lead to different numerical values, and,\\r\\nfurther, that the divergence of the two results would increase as the\\r\\nvelocity of the rod was increased. In assigning a number, therefore,\\r\\nto the length of a moving rod, one must make a choice of the method to\\r\\nbe used in measuring it. Obviously the preferable method is to agree\\r\\nthat the observer shall move with the rod, carrying his measuring\\r\\ninstrument with him. This disposes of the problem of measuring space\\r\\nrelations. The observed fact that, if we measure the length of the rod\\r\\non different days, or when the rod is lying in different positions,\\r\\nwe always obtain the same value offers no information concerning the\\r\\n\"real\" length of the rod. It may have changed, or it may not. It\\r\\nmust always be remembered that measurement of the length of a\\r\\nrod is simply a process of comparison between it and an arbitrary\\r\\nstandard, e.g., a meter-rod or yard-stick. In regard to the problem\\r\\nof assigning numbers to intervals of time, it must be borne in mind\\r\\nthat, strictly speaking, we do not \"measure\" such intervals, i.e.,\\r\\nthat we do not select a unit interval of time and find how many times\\r\\nit is contained in the interval in question. (Similarly, we do not\\r\\n\"measure\" the pitch of a sound or the temperature of a room.) Our\\r\\npractical instruments for assigning numbers to time-intervals depend\\r\\nin the main upon our agreeing to believe that a pendulum swings in\\r\\na perfectly uniform manner, each vibration taking the same time as\\r\\nthe next one. Of course we cannot prove that this is true, it is,\\r\\nstrictly speaking, a definition of what we mean by equal intervals\\r\\nof time; and it is not a particularly good definition at that. Its\\r\\nlimitations are sufficiently obvious. The best way to proceed is\\r\\nto consider the concept of uniform velocity, and then, using the\\r\\nidea of some entity having such a uniform velocity, to define equal\\r\\nintervals of time as such intervals as are required for the entity\\r\\nto traverse equal lengths. These last we have already defined. What\\r\\nis required in addition is to adopt some moving entity as giving our\\r\\ndefinition of uniform velocity. Considering our known universe it\\r\\nis self-evident that we should choose in our definition of uniform\\r\\nvelocity the velocity of light, since this selection could be made by\\r\\nan observer anywhere in our universe. Having agreed then to illustrate\\r\\nby the words \"uniform velocity\" that of light, our definition of equal\\r\\nintervals of time is complete. This implies, of course, that there is\\r\\nno uncertainty on our part as to the fact that the velocity of light\\r\\nalways has the same value at any one point in the universe to any\\r\\nobserver, quite regardless of the source of light. In other words,\\r\\nthe postulate that this is true underlies our definition. Following\\r\\nthis method Einstein developed a system of measuring both space and\\r\\ntime intervals. As a matter of fact his system is identically that\\r\\nwhich we use in daily life with reference to events here on the\\r\\nearth. He further showed that if a man were to measure the length\\r\\nof a rod, for instance, on the earth and then were able to carry the\\r\\nrod and his measuring apparatus to Mars, the sun, or to Arcturus he\\r\\nwould obtain the same numerical value for the length in all places\\r\\nand at all times. This doesn\\'t mean that any statement is implied\\r\\nas to whether the length of the rod has remained unchanged or not;\\r\\nsuch words do not have any meaning--remember that we can not speak of\\r\\ntrue length. It is thus clear that an observer living on the earth\\r\\nwould have a definite system of units in terms of which to express\\r\\nspace and time intervals, i.e., he would have a definite system\\r\\nof space coordinates (x, y, z) and a definite time coordinate (t);\\r\\nand similarly an observer living on Mars would have his system of\\r\\ncoordinates (x\\', y\\', z\\', t\\'). Provided that one observer has a definite\\r\\nuniform velocity with reference to the other, it is a comparatively\\r\\nsimple matter to deduce the mathematical relations between the two\\r\\nsets of coordinates. When Einstein did this, he arrived at the same\\r\\ntransformation formulæ as those used by Lorentz in his development of\\r\\nMaxwell\\'s equations. The latter had shown that, using these formulæ,\\r\\nthe form of the laws for all electromagnetic phenomena maintained\\r\\nthe same form; so Einstein\\'s method proves that using his system of\\r\\nmeasurement an observer, anywhere in the universe, would as the result\\r\\nof his own investigation of electromagnetic phenomena arrive at the\\r\\nsame mathematical statement of them as any other observer, provided\\r\\nonly that the relative-velocity of the two observers was uniform.\\r\\n\\r\\nEinstein discussed many other most important questions at this time;\\r\\nbut it is not necessary to refer to them in connection with the\\r\\npresent subject. So far as this is concerned, the next important\\r\\nstep to note is that taken in the famous address of Minkowski, in\\r\\n1908, on the subject of \"Space and Time.\" It would be difficult to\\r\\noverstate the importance of the concepts advanced by Minkowski. They\\r\\nmarked the beginning of a new period in the philosophy of physics. I\\r\\nshall not attempt to explain his ideas in detail, but shall confine\\r\\nmyself to a few general statements. His point of view and his line of\\r\\ndevelopment of the theme are absolutely different from those of Lorentz\\r\\nor of Einstein; but in the end he makes use of the same transformation\\r\\nformulæ. His great contribution consists in giving us a new geometrical\\r\\npicture of their meaning. It is scarcely fair to call Minkowski\\'s\\r\\ndevelopment a picture; for to us a picture can never have more than\\r\\nthree dimensions, our senses limit us; while his picture calls for\\r\\nperception of four dimensions. It is this fact that renders any even\\r\\nsemi-popular discussion of Minkowski\\'s work so impossible. We can all\\r\\nsee that for us to describe any event a knowledge of four coordinates\\r\\nis necessary, three for the space specification and one for the time. A\\r\\ncomplete picture could be given then by a point in four dimensions. All\\r\\nfour coordinates are necessary: we never observe an event except at\\r\\na certain time, and we never observe an instant of time except with\\r\\nreference to space. Discussing the laws of electromagnetic phenomena,\\r\\nMinkowski showed how in a space of four dimensions, by a suitable\\r\\ndefinition of axes, the mathematical transformation of Lorentz and\\r\\nEinstein could be described by a rotation of the set of axes. We are\\r\\nall accustomed to a rotation of our ordinary cartesian set of axes\\r\\ndescribing the position of a point. We ordinarily choose our axes at\\r\\nany location on the earth as follows: one vertical, one east and west,\\r\\none north and south. So if we move from any one laboratory to another,\\r\\nwe change our axes; they are always orthogonal, but in moving from\\r\\nplace to place there is a rotation. Similarly, Minkowski showed that\\r\\nif we choose four orthogonal axes at any point on the earth, according\\r\\nto his method, to represent a space-time point using the method of\\r\\nmeasuring space and time intervals as outlined by Einstein; and, if\\r\\nan observer on Arcturus used a similar set of axes and the method of\\r\\nmeasurement which he naturally would, the set of axes of the latter\\r\\ncould be obtained from those of the observer on the earth by a pure\\r\\nrotation (and naturally a transfer of the origin). This is a beautiful\\r\\ngeometrical result. To complete my statement of the method, I must\\r\\nadd that instead of using as his fourth axis one along which numerical\\r\\nvalues of time are laid off, Minkowski defined his fourth coordinate\\r\\nas the product of time and the imaginary constant, the square root of\\r\\nminus one. This introduction of imaginary quantities might be expected,\\r\\npossibly, to introduce difficulties; but, in reality, it is the very\\r\\nessence of the simplicity of the geometrical description just given\\r\\nof the rotation of the sets of axes. It thus appears that different\\r\\nobservers situated at different points in the universe would each have\\r\\ntheir own set of axes, all different, yet all connected by the fact\\r\\nthat any one can be rotated so as to coincide with any other. This\\r\\nmeans that there is no one direction in the four-dimensional space\\r\\nthat corresponds to time for all observers. Just as with reference to\\r\\nthe earth there is no direction which can be called vertical for all\\r\\nobservers living on the earth. In the sense of an absolute meaning\\r\\nthe words \"up and down,\" \"before and after,\" \"sooner or later,\"\\r\\nare entirely meaningless.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis concept of Minkowski\\'s may be made clearer, perhaps, by the\\r\\nfollowing process of thought. If we take a section through our\\r\\nthree-dimensional space, we have a plane, i.e., a two-dimensional\\r\\nspace. Similarly, if a section is made through a four-dimensional\\r\\nspace, one of three dimensions is obtained. Thus, for an observer on\\r\\nthe earth a definite section of Minkowski\\'s four-dimensional space will\\r\\ngive us our ordinary three-dimensional one; so that this section will,\\r\\nas it were, break up Minkowski\\'s space into our space and give us our\\r\\nordinary time. Similarly, a different section would have to be used\\r\\nto the observer on Arcturus; but by a suitable selection he would\\r\\nget his own familiar three-dimensional space and his own time. Thus\\r\\nthe space defined by Minkowski is completely isotropic in reference\\r\\nto measured lengths and times, there is absolutely no difference\\r\\nbetween any two directions in an absolute sense; for any particular\\r\\nobserver, of course, a particular section will cause the space to\\r\\nfall apart so as to suit his habits of measurement; any section,\\r\\nhowever, taken at random will do the same thing for some observer\\r\\nsomewhere. From another point of view, that of Lorentz and Einstein,\\r\\nit is obvious that, since this four-dimensional space is isotropic,\\r\\nthe expression of the laws of electromagnetic phenomena take identical\\r\\nmathematical forms when expressed by any observer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question of course must be raised as to what can be said in regard\\r\\nto phenomena which so far as we know do not have an electromagnetic\\r\\norigin. In particular what can be done with respect to gravitational\\r\\nphenomena? Before, however, showing how this problem was attacked by\\r\\nEinstein; and the fact that the subject of my address is Einstein\\'s\\r\\nwork on gravitation shows that ultimately I shall explain this, I\\r\\nmust emphasize another feature of Minkowski\\'s geometry. To describe\\r\\nthe space-time characteristics of any event a point, defined by its\\r\\nfour coordinates, is sufficient; so, if one observes the life-history\\r\\nof any entity, e.g., a particle of matter, a light-wave, etc., he\\r\\nobserves a sequence of points in the space-time continuum; that is,\\r\\nthe life-history of any entity is described fully by a line in this\\r\\nspace. Such a line was called by Minkowski a \"world-line.\" Further,\\r\\nfrom a different point of view, all of our observations of nature\\r\\nare in reality observations of coincidences, e.g., if one reads\\r\\na thermometer, what he does is to note the coincidence of the\\r\\nend of the column of mercury with a certain scale division on\\r\\nthe thermometer tube. In other words, thinking of the world-line\\r\\nof the end of the mercury column and the world-line of the scale\\r\\ndivision, what we have observed was the intersection or crossing of\\r\\nthese lines. In a similar manner any observation may be analyzed;\\r\\nand remembering that light rays, a point on the retina of the eye,\\r\\netc., all have their world-lines, it will be recognized that it is\\r\\na perfectly accurate statement to say that every observation is the\\r\\nperception of the intersection of world-lines. Further, since all we\\r\\nknow of a world-line is the result of observations, it is evident\\r\\nthat we do not know a world-line as a continuous series of points,\\r\\nbut simply as a series of discontinuous points, each point being where\\r\\nthe particular world-line in question is crossed by another world-line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is clear, moreover, that for the description of a world-line\\r\\nwe are not limited to the particular set of four orthogonal axes\\r\\nadopted by Minkowski. We can choose any set of four-dimensional\\r\\naxes we wish. It is further evident that the mathematical expression\\r\\nfor the coincidence of two points is absolutely independent of our\\r\\nselection of reference axes. If we change our axes, we will change\\r\\nthe coordinates of both points simultaneously, so that the question\\r\\nof axes ceases to be of interest. But our so-called laws of nature are\\r\\nnothing but descriptions in mathematical language of our observations;\\r\\nwe observe only coincidences; a sequence of coincidences when put in\\r\\nmathematical terms takes a form which is independent of the selection\\r\\nof reference axes; therefore the mathematical expression of our laws\\r\\nof nature, of every character, must be such that their form does\\r\\nnot change if we make a transformation of axes. This is a simple but\\r\\nfar-reaching deduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a geometrical method of picturing the effect of a change\\r\\nof axes of reference, i.e., of a mathematical transformation. To a\\r\\nman in a railway coach the path of a drop of water does not appear\\r\\nvertical, i.e., it is not parallel to the edge of the window; still\\r\\nless so does it appear vertical to a man performing manoeuvres in\\r\\nan airplane. This means that whereas with reference to axes fixed\\r\\nto the earth the path of the drop is vertical; with reference to\\r\\nother axes, the path is not. Or, stating the conclusion in general\\r\\nlanguage, changing the axes of reference (or effecting a mathematical\\r\\ntransformation) in general changes the shape of any line. If one\\r\\nimagines the line forming a part of the space, it is evident that\\r\\nif the space is deformed by compression or expansion the shape of\\r\\nthe line is changed, and if sufficient care is taken it is clearly\\r\\npossible, by deforming the space, to make the line take any shape\\r\\ndesired, or better stated, any shape specified by the previous change\\r\\nof axes. It is thus possible to picture a mathematical transformation\\r\\nas a deformation of space. Thus I can draw a line on a sheet of paper\\r\\nor of rubber and by bending and stretching the sheet, I can make the\\r\\nline assume a great variety of shapes; each of these new shapes is\\r\\na picture of a suitable transformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, consider world-lines in our four-dimensional space. The\\r\\ncomplete record of all our knowledge is a series of sequences of\\r\\nintersections of such lines. By analogy I can draw in ordinary space\\r\\na great number of intersecting lines on a sheet of rubber; I can\\r\\nthen bend and deform the sheet to please myself; by so doing I do\\r\\nnot introduce any new intersections nor do I alter in the least the\\r\\nsequence of intersections. So in the space of our world-lines, the\\r\\nspace may be deformed in any imaginable manner without introducing\\r\\nany new intersections or changing the sequence of the existing\\r\\nintersections. It is this sequence which gives us the mathematical\\r\\nexpression of our so-called experimental laws; a deformation of\\r\\nour space is equivalent mathematically to a transformation of axes,\\r\\nconsequently we see why it is that the form of our laws must be the\\r\\nsame when referred to any and all sets of axes, that is, must remain\\r\\nunaltered by any mathematical transformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, at last we come to gravitation. We can not imagine any world-line\\r\\nsimpler than that of a particle of matter left to itself; we shall\\r\\ntherefore call it a \"straight\" line. Our experience is that two\\r\\nparticles of matter attract one another. Expressed in terms of\\r\\nworld-lines, this means that, if the world-lines of two isolated\\r\\nparticles come near each other, the lines, instead of being straight,\\r\\nwill be deflected or bent in towards each other. The world-line of\\r\\nany one particle is therefore deformed; and we have just seen that a\\r\\ndeformation is the equivalent of a mathematical transformation. In\\r\\nother words, for any one particle it is possible to replace the\\r\\neffect of a gravitational field at any instant by a mathematical\\r\\ntransformation of axes. The statement that this is always possible\\r\\nfor any particle at any instant is Einstein\\'s famous \"Principle\\r\\nof Equivalence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us rest for a moment, while I call attention to a most interesting\\r\\ncoincidence, not to be thought of as an intersection of world-lines. It\\r\\nis said that Newton\\'s thoughts were directed to the observation of\\r\\ngravitational phenomena by an apple falling on his head; from this\\r\\nstriking event he passed by natural steps to a consideration of the\\r\\nuniversality of gravitation. Einstein in describing his mental process\\r\\nin the evolution of his law of gravitation says that his attention\\r\\nwas called to a new point of view by discussing his experiences with\\r\\na man whose fall from a high building he had just witnessed. The man\\r\\nfortunately suffered no serious injuries and assured Einstein that in\\r\\nthe course of his fall he had not been conscious in the least of any\\r\\npull downward on his body. In mathematical language, with reference to\\r\\naxes moving with the man the force of gravity had disappeared. This is\\r\\na case where by the transfer of the axes from the earth itself to the\\r\\nman, the force of the gravitational field is annulled. The converse\\r\\nchange of axes from the falling man to a point on the earth could be\\r\\nconsidered as introducing the force of gravity into the equations of\\r\\nmotion. Another illustration of the introduction into our equations of\\r\\na force by a means of a change of axes is furnished by the ordinary\\r\\ntreatment of a body in uniform rotation about an axis. For instance,\\r\\nin the case of a so-called conical pendulum, that is, the motion of a\\r\\nbob suspended from a fixed point by string, which is so set in motion\\r\\nthat the bob describes a horizontal circle and the string therefore\\r\\ndescribes a circular cone, if we transfer our axes from the earth and\\r\\nhave them rotate around the vertical line through the fixed point with\\r\\nthe same angular velocity as the bob, it is necessary to introduce into\\r\\nour equations of motion a fictitious \"force\" called the centrifugal\\r\\nforce. No one ever thinks of this force other than as a mathematical\\r\\nquantity introduced into the equations for the sake of simplicity of\\r\\ntreatment; no physical meaning is attached to it. Why should there\\r\\nbe to any other so-called \"force,\" which like centrifugal force,\\r\\nis independent of the nature of the matter? Again, here on the earth\\r\\nour sensation of weight is interpreted mathematically by combining\\r\\nexpressions for centrifugal force and gravity; we have no distinct\\r\\nsensation for either separately. Why then is there any difference in\\r\\nthe essence of the two? Why not consider them both as brought into\\r\\nour equations by the agency of mathematical transformations? This is\\r\\nEinstein\\'s point of view.\\r\\n\\r\\nGranting, then, the principle of equivalence, we can so choose axes at\\r\\nany point at any instant that the gravitational field will disappear;\\r\\nthese axes are therefore of what Eddington calls the \"Galilean\"\\r\\ntype, the simplest possible. Consider, that is, an observer in a\\r\\nbox, or compartment, which is falling with the acceleration of the\\r\\ngravitational field at that point. He would not be conscious of the\\r\\nfield. If there were a projectile fired off in this compartment,\\r\\nthe observer would describe its path as being straight. In this space\\r\\nthe infinitesimal interval between two space-time points would then\\r\\nbe given by the formula\\r\\n\\r\\n    $$ds^2 = dx^2_1 + dx2_2 + dx^2_3 + dx2_4,$$\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere ds is the interval and $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ are coordinates. If\\r\\nwe make a mathematical transformation, i.e., use another set of axes,\\r\\nthis interval would obviously take the form\\r\\n\\r\\n    $$ds^2 = g_{11}dx^2_{33} + g_{22}dx^2_2 + g_{33}dx^2_3 +\\r\\n      g_{44}dx2_4 + 2g_{12}dx_1dx_2 + \\\\rm{etc.},$$\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and $x_4$ are now coordinates referring to the\\r\\nnew axes. This relation involves ten coefficients, the coefficients\\r\\ndefining the transformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of course a certain dynamical value is also attached to the\\r\\ng\\'s, because by the transfer of our axes from the Galilean type\\r\\nwe have made a change which is equivalent to the introduction of\\r\\na gravitational field; and the g\\'s must specify the field. That\\r\\nis, these g\\'s are the expressions of our experiences, and hence\\r\\ntheir values can not depend upon the use of any special axes; the\\r\\nvalues must be the same for all selections. In other words, whatever\\r\\nfunction of the coordinates any one g is for one set of axes, if other\\r\\naxes are chosen, this g must still be the same function of the new\\r\\ncoordinates. There are ten g\\'s defined by differential equations;\\r\\nso we have ten covariant equations. Einstein showed how these g\\'s\\r\\ncould be regarded as generalized potentials of the field. Our own\\r\\nexperiments and observations upon gravitation have given us a certain\\r\\nknowledge concerning its potential; that is, we know a value for it\\r\\nwhich must be so near the truth that we can properly call it at least\\r\\na first approximation. Or, stated differently, if Einstein succeeds in\\r\\ndeducing the rigid value for the gravitational potential in any field,\\r\\nit must degenerate to the Newtonian value for the great majority of\\r\\ncases with which we have actual experience. Einstein\\'s method, then,\\r\\nwas to investigate the functions (or equations) which would satisfy\\r\\nthe mathematical conditions just described. A transformation from\\r\\nthe axes used by the observer in the following box may be made so as\\r\\nto introduce into the equations the gravitational field recognized\\r\\nby an observer on the earth near the box; but this, obviously, would\\r\\nnot be the general gravitational field, because the field changes as\\r\\none moves over the surface of the earth. A solution found, therefore,\\r\\nas just indicated, would not be the one sought for the general field;\\r\\nand another must be found which is less stringent than the former\\r\\nbut reduces to it as a special case. He found himself at liberty to\\r\\nmake a selection from among several possibilities, and for several\\r\\nreasons chose the simplest solution. He then tested this decision\\r\\nby seeing if his formulæ would degenerate to Newton\\'s law for the\\r\\nlimiting case of velocities small when compared with that of light,\\r\\nbecause this condition is satisfied in those cases to which Newton\\'s\\r\\nlaw applies. His formulæ satisfied this test, and he therefore was\\r\\nable to announce a \"law of gravitation,\" of which Newton\\'s was a\\r\\nspecial form for a simple case.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the ordinary scholar the difficulties surmounted by Einstein in\\r\\nhis investigations appear stupendous. It is not improbable that the\\r\\nstatement which he is alleged to have made to his editor, that only\\r\\nten men in the world could understand his treatment of the subject,\\r\\nis true. I am fully prepared to believe it, and wish to add that I\\r\\ncertainly am not one of the ten. But I can also say that, after a\\r\\ncareful and serious study of his papers, I feel confident that there\\r\\nis nothing in them which I can not understand, given the time to become\\r\\nfamiliar with the special mathematical processes used. The more I work\\r\\nover Einstein\\'s papers, the more impressed I am, not simply by his\\r\\ngenius in viewing the problem, but also by his great technical skill.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the path outlined, Einstein, as just said, arrived at certain\\r\\nmathematical laws for a gravitational field, laws which reduced\\r\\nto Newton\\'s form in most cases where observations are possible,\\r\\nbut which led to different conclusions in a few cases, knowledge\\r\\nconcerning which we might obtain by careful observations. I shall\\r\\nmention a few deductions from Einstein\\'s formulæ.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. If a heavy particle is put at the center of a circle, and, if\\r\\nthe length of the circumference and the length of the diameter\\r\\nare measured, it will be found that their ratio is not [pi]\\r\\n(3.14159). In other words the geometrical properties of space in such\\r\\na gravitational field are not those discussed by Euclid; the space is,\\r\\nthen, non-Euclidean. There is no way by which this deduction can be\\r\\nverified, the difference between the predicted ratio and [pi] is\\r\\ntoo minute for us to hope to make our measurements with sufficient\\r\\nexactness to determine the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. All the lines in the solar spectrum should with reference to lines\\r\\nobtained by terrestrial sources be displaced slightly towards longer\\r\\nwave-lengths. The amount of displacement predicted for lines in the\\r\\nblue end of the spectrum is about one-hundredth of an Angstrom unit,\\r\\na quantity well within experimental limits. Unfortunately, as far\\r\\nas the testing of this prediction is concerned, there are several\\r\\nphysical causes which are also operating to cause displacement of the\\r\\nspectrum-lines; and so at present a decision can not be rendered as\\r\\nto the verification. St. John and other workers at the Mount Wilson\\r\\nObservatory have the question under investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. According to Newton\\'s law an isolated planet in its motion around a\\r\\ncentral sun would describe, period after period, the same elliptical\\r\\norbit; whereas Einstein\\'s laws lead to the prediction that the\\r\\nsuccessive orbits traversed would not be identically the same. Each\\r\\nrevolution would start the planet off on an orbit very approximately\\r\\nelliptical, but with the major axis of the ellipse rotated slightly in\\r\\nthe plane of the orbit. When calculations were made for the various\\r\\nplanets in our solar system, it was found that the only one which\\r\\nwas of interest from the standpoint of verification of Einstein\\'s\\r\\nformulæ was Mercury. It has been known for a long time that there\\r\\nwas actually such a change as just described in the orbit of Mercury,\\r\\namounting to 574\\'\\' of arc per century; and it has been shown that of\\r\\nthis a rotation of 532\\'\\' was due to the direct action of other planets,\\r\\nthus leaving an unexplained rotation of 42\\'\\' per century. Einstein\\'s\\r\\nformulæ predicted a rotation of 43\\'\\', a striking agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. In accordance with Einstein\\'s formulæ a ray of light passing close\\r\\nto a heavy piece of matter, the sun, for instance, should experience\\r\\na sensible deflection in towards the sun. This might be expected from\\r\\n\"general\" consideration of energy in motion; energy and mass are\\r\\ngenerally considered to be identical in the sense that an amount\\r\\nof energy E has the mass $E1c^2$ where c is the velocity of light;\\r\\nand consequently a ray of light might fall within the province of\\r\\ngravitation and the amount of deflection to be expected could be\\r\\ncalculated by the ordinary formula for gravitation. Another point\\r\\nof view is to consider again the observer inside the compartment\\r\\nfalling with the acceleration of the gravitational field. To him the\\r\\npath of a projectile and a ray of light would both appear straight;\\r\\nso that, if the projectile had a velocity equal to that of light, it\\r\\nand the light wave would travel side by side. To an observer outside\\r\\nthe compartment, e.g., to one on the earth, both would then appear\\r\\nto have the same deflection owing to the sun. But how much would\\r\\nthe path of the projectile be bent? What would be the shape of its\\r\\nparabola? One might apply Newton\\'s law; but, according to Einstein\\'s\\r\\nformulæ, Newton\\'s law should be used only for small velocities. In the\\r\\ncase of a ray passing close to the sun it was decided that according\\r\\nto Einstein\\'s formula there should be a deflection of 1\\'\\'.75 whereas\\r\\nNewton\\'s law of gravitation predicted half this amount. Careful\\r\\nplans were made by various astronomers, to investigate this question\\r\\nat the solar eclipse last May, and the result announced by Dyson,\\r\\nEddington and Crommelin, the leaders of astronomy in England, was\\r\\nthat there was a deflection of 1\\'\\'.9. Of course the detection of such\\r\\na minute deflection was an extraordinarily difficult matter, so many\\r\\ncorrections had to be applied to the original observations; but the\\r\\nnames of the men who record the conclusions are such as to inspire\\r\\nconfidence. Certainly any effect of refraction seems to be excluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is thus seen that the formulæ deduced by Einstein have been\\r\\nconfirmed in a variety of ways and in a most brilliant manner. In\\r\\nconnection with these formulæ one question must arise in the minds of\\r\\neveryone; by what process, where in the course of the mathematical\\r\\ndevelopment, does the idea of mass reveal itself? It was not in\\r\\nthe equations at the beginning and yet here it is at the end. How\\r\\ndoes it appear? As a matter of fact it is first seen as a constant\\r\\nof integration in the discussion of the problem of the gravitational\\r\\nfield due to a single particle; and the identity of this constant with\\r\\nmass is proved when one compares Einstein\\'s formulæ with Newton\\'s\\r\\nlaw which is simply its degenerated form. This mass, though, is the\\r\\nmass of which we become aware through our experiences with weight;\\r\\nand Einstein proceeded to prove that this quantity which entered as\\r\\na constant of integration in his ideally simple problem also obeyed\\r\\nthe laws of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum when\\r\\nhe investigated the problems of two and more particles. Therefore\\r\\nEinstein deduced from his study of gravitational fields the well-known\\r\\nproperties of matter which form the basis of theoretical mechanics. A\\r\\nfurther logical consequence of Einstein\\'s development is to show that\\r\\nenergy has mass, a concept with which every one nowadays is familiar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe description of Einstein\\'s method which I have given so far is\\r\\nsimply the story of one success after another; and it is certainly\\r\\nfair to ask if we have at last reached finality in our investigation\\r\\nof nature, if we have attained to truth. Are there no outstanding\\r\\ndifficulties? Is there no possibility of error? Certainly, not\\r\\nuntil all the predictions made from Einstein\\'s formulæ have been\\r\\ninvestigated can much be said; and further, it must be seen whether\\r\\nany other lines of argument will lead to the same conclusions. But\\r\\nwithout waiting for all this there is at least one difficulty which\\r\\nis apparent at this time. We have discussed the laws of nature as\\r\\nindependent in their form of reference axes, a concept which appeals\\r\\nstrongly to our philosophy; yet it is not at all clear, at first sight,\\r\\nthat we can be justified in our belief. We can not imagine any way\\r\\nby which we can become conscious of the translation of the earth in\\r\\nspace; but by means of gyroscopes we can learn a great deal about its\\r\\nrotation on its axis. We could locate the positions of its two poles,\\r\\nand by watching a Foucault pendulum or a gyroscope we can obtain a\\r\\nnumber which we interpret as the angular velocity of rotation of axes\\r\\nfixed in the earth; angular velocity with reference to what? Where\\r\\nis the fundamental set of axes? This is a real difficulty. It can be\\r\\nsurmounted in several ways. Einstein himself has outlined a method\\r\\nwhich in the end amounts to assuming the existence on the confines\\r\\nof space of vast quantities of matter, a proposition which is not\\r\\nattractive. deSitter has suggested a peculiar quality of the space\\r\\nto which we refer our space-time coordinates. The consequences of\\r\\nthis are most interesting, but no decision can as yet be made as to\\r\\nthe justification of the hypothesis. In any case we can say that\\r\\nthe difficulty raised is not one that destroys the real value of\\r\\nEinstein\\'s work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion I wish to emphasize the fact, which should be obvious,\\r\\nthat Einstein has not attempted any explanation of gravitation;\\r\\nhe has been occupied with the deduction of its laws. These laws,\\r\\ntogether with those of electromagnetic phenomena, comprise our store\\r\\nof knowledge. There is not the slightest indication of a mechanism,\\r\\nmeaning by that a picture in terms of our senses. In fact what we have\\r\\nlearned has been to realize that our desire to use such mechanisms\\r\\nis futile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DEFLECTION OF LIGHT BY GRAVITATION AND THE EINSTEIN THEORY OF\\r\\nRELATIVITY. [16]\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Frank Dyson\\r\\nthe Astronomer Royal\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purpose of the expedition was to determine whether any displacement\\r\\nis caused to a ray of light by the gravitational field of the sun,\\r\\nand if so, the amount of the displacement. Einstein\\'s theory predicted\\r\\na displacement varying inversely as the distance of the ray from\\r\\nthe sun\\'s center, amounting to 1\\'\\'.75 for a star seen just grazing\\r\\nthe sun....\\r\\n\\r\\nA study of the conditions of the 1919 eclipse showed that the sun\\r\\nwould be very favorably placed among a group of bright stars--in fact,\\r\\nit would be in the most favorable possible position. A study of the\\r\\nconditions at various points on the path of the eclipse, in which\\r\\nMr. Hinks helped us, pointed to Sobral, in Brazil, and Principe, an\\r\\nisland off the west coast of Africa, as the most favorable stations....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greenwich party, Dr. Crommelin and Mr. Davidson, reached Brazil\\r\\nin ample time to prepare for the eclipse, and the usual preliminary\\r\\nfocusing by photographing stellar fields was carried out. The day of\\r\\nthe eclipse opened cloudy, but cleared later, and the observations\\r\\nwere carried out with almost complete success. With the astrographic\\r\\ntelescope Mr. Davidson secured 15 out of 18 photographs showing the\\r\\nrequired stellar images. Totality lasted 6 minutes, and the average\\r\\nexposure of the plates was 5 to 6 seconds. Dr. Crommelin with the\\r\\nother lens had 7 successful plates out of 8. The unsuccessful plates\\r\\nwere spoiled for this purpose by the clouds, but show the remarkable\\r\\nprominence very well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the plates were developed the astrographic images were found to\\r\\nbe out of focus. This is attributed to the effect of the sun\\'s heat\\r\\non the coelostat mirror. The images were fuzzy and quite different\\r\\nfrom those on the check-plates secured at night before and after the\\r\\neclipse. Fortunately the mirror which fed the 4-inch lens was not\\r\\naffected, and the star images secured with this lens were good and\\r\\nsimilar to those got by the night-plates. The observers stayed on in\\r\\nBrazil until July to secure the field in the night sky at the altitude\\r\\nof the eclipse epoch and under identical instrumental conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plates were measured at Greenwich immediately after the observers\\'\\r\\nreturn. Each plate was measured twice over by Messrs. Davidson and\\r\\nFurner, and I am satisfied that such faults as lie in the results\\r\\nare in the plates themselves and not in the measures. The figures\\r\\nobtained may be briefly summarized as follows: The astrographic plates\\r\\ngave 0\\'\\'.97 for the displacement at the limb when the scale-value was\\r\\ndetermined from the plates themselves, and 1\\'\\'.40 when the scale-value\\r\\nwas assumed from the check plates. But the much better plates gave\\r\\nfor the displacement at the limb 1\\'\\'.98, Einstein\\'s predicted value\\r\\nbeing 1\\'\\'.75. Further, for these plates the agreement was all that\\r\\ncould be expected....\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a careful study of the plates I am prepared to say that there\\r\\ncan be no doubt that they confirm Einstein\\'s prediction. A very\\r\\ndefinite result has been obtained that light is deflected according\\r\\nto Einstein\\'s law of gravitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor A. S. Eddington\\r\\nRoyal Observatory\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Cottingham and I left the other observers at Madeira and arrived\\r\\nat Principe on April 23.... We soon realized that the prospect of\\r\\na clear sky at the end of May was not very good. Not even a heavy\\r\\nthunderstorm on the morning of the eclipse, three weeks after the end\\r\\nof the wet season, saved the situation. The sky was completely cloudy\\r\\nat first contact, but about half an hour before totality we began to\\r\\nsee glimpses of the sun\\'s crescent through the clouds. We carried\\r\\nout our program exactly as arranged, and the sky must have been\\r\\nclearer towards the end of totality. Of the 16 plates taken during\\r\\nthe five minutes of totality the first ten showed no stars at all;\\r\\nof the later plates two showed five stars each, from which a result\\r\\ncould be obtained. Comparing them with the check-plates secured at\\r\\nOxford before we went out, we obtained as the final result from the\\r\\ntwo plates for the value of the displacement of the limb 1\\'\\'.6 ±\\r\\n0.3.... This result supports the figures obtained at Sobral....\\r\\n\\r\\nI will pass now to a few words on the meaning of the result. It points\\r\\nto the larger of the two possible values of the deflection. The\\r\\nsimplest interpretation of the bending of the ray is to consider\\r\\nit as an effect of the weight of light. We know that momentum is\\r\\ncarried along on the path of a beam of light. Gravity in acting\\r\\ncreates momentum in a direction different from that of the path of\\r\\nthe ray and so causes it to bend. For the half-effect we have to\\r\\nassume that gravity obeys Newton\\'s law; for the full effect which has\\r\\nbeen obtained we must assume that gravity obeys the new law proposed\\r\\nby Einstein. This is one of the most crucial tests between Newton\\'s\\r\\nlaw and the proposed new law. Einstein\\'s law had already indicated a\\r\\nperturbation, causing the orbit of Mercury to revolve. That confirms\\r\\nit for relatively small velocities. Going to the limit, where the\\r\\nspeed is that of light, the perturbation is increased in such a way\\r\\nas to double the curvature of the path, and this is now confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis effect may be taken as proving Einstein\\'s law rather than his\\r\\ntheory. It is not affected by the failure to detect the displacement\\r\\nof Fraunhofer lines on the sun. If this latter failure is confirmed\\r\\nit will not affect Einstein\\'s law of gravitation, but it will affect\\r\\nthe views on which the law was arrived at. The law is right, though\\r\\nthe fundamental ideas underlying it may yet be questioned....\\r\\n\\r\\nOne further point must be touched upon. Are we to attribute the\\r\\ndisplacement to the gravitational field and not to the refracting\\r\\nmatter around the sun? The refractive index required to produce the\\r\\nresult at a distance of 15\\' from the sun would be that given by gases\\r\\nat a pressure of 1/60 to 1/200 of an atmosphere. This is of too great\\r\\na density considering the depth through which the light would have\\r\\nto pass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir J. J. Thomson\\r\\nPresident of the Royal Society\\r\\n\\r\\n... If the results obtained had been only that light was affected by\\r\\ngravitation, it would have been of the greatest importance. Newton,\\r\\ndid, in fact, suggest this very point in his \"Optics,\" and his\\r\\nsuggestion would presumably have led to the half-value. But this result\\r\\nis not an isolated one; it is part of a whole continent of scientific\\r\\nideas affecting the most fundamental concepts of physics.... This is\\r\\nthe most important result obtained in connection with the theory of\\r\\ngravitation since Newton\\'s day, and it is fitting that it should be\\r\\nannounced at a meeting of the society so closely connected with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difference between the laws of gravitation of Einstein and Newton\\r\\ncome only in special cases. The real interest of Einstein\\'s theory\\r\\nlies not so much in his results as in the method by which he gets\\r\\nthem. If his theory is right, it makes us take an entirely new view\\r\\nof gravitation. If it is sustained that Einstein\\'s reasoning holds\\r\\ngood--and it has survived two very severe tests in connection with the\\r\\nperihelion of mercury and the present eclipse--then it is the result\\r\\nof one of the highest achievements of human thought. The weak point\\r\\nin the theory is the great difficulty in expressing it. It would\\r\\nseem that no one can understand the new law of gravitation without\\r\\na thorough knowledge of the theory of invariants and of the calculus\\r\\nof variations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne other point of physical interest arises from the discussion. Light\\r\\nis deflected in passing near huge bodies of matter. This involves\\r\\nalterations in the electric and magnetic field. This, again, implies\\r\\nthe existence of electric and magnetic forces outside matter--forces\\r\\nat present unknown, though some idea of their nature may be got from\\r\\nthe results of this expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] See Note 1 at the end of the volume.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] See Note 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] See Note 3.\\r\\n\\r\\n[4] A circle--in our case the horizon--is measured by dividing the\\r\\ncircumference into 360 parts; each part is called a degree.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\r\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\r\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\r\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\r\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\r\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\r\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"
